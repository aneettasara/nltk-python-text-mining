The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005, recommends that children’s life at school
must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the
legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between
the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF
signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning
and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these
measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of
education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).
The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will
take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities
and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate
new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the
prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other
resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible
if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body
of knowledge.
These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning.
Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual
calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The
methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook
proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of
stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden
by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration
for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance
this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and
wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.
The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the
hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We
wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics,
Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor K. Muralidhar,
Department of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi for guiding the work of this committee.
Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook. We are grateful to their
principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations
which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel.
We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed
IIIby the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource
Development under the Chairmanship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande,
for their valuable time and contribution.
As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the
quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to
undertake further revision and refinement.

IVPREFACE
Biology is the study of life in its entirety. The growth of biology as a natural science during
the last 1000 years is interesting from many points of view. One feature of this growth is
changing emphasis. Initially it was description of life forms. Identification, nomenclature,
classification of all recorded living forms enjoyed the attention of scientists for a long time.
Description of their habitats and (in the case of animals) their behaviour was included in
this study. In later years, the focus was physiology and internal morphology or anatomy.
Darwinian ideas of evolution by natural selection changed the perception completely. Classical
descriptive and clueless biology found a theoretical framework in the evolutionary theory of
Darwin.
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Physics and Chemistry were applied to Biology
and the new science of Biochemistry soon became the dominant face of biology. On one hand
Biochemistry was integrating with Physiology, becoming almost synonymous with it. On the
other hand it gave rise to Structural Biology (structure of biomacromolecules), originally called
Molecular Biology. The work of Bernal, Pauling, Watson and Crick, Hodgkins, Perutz and Kendrew,
Delbruck, Luria, Monod, Beadle and Tatum, Lederberg, Brenner, Benzer, Nirenberg, Khorana,
Mclintock, Sanger, Cohen, Boyer, Kornbergs (father and son), Leder, Chambon and scores of
others brought in and established a modern version of Molecular Biology dealing with life
processes at molecular level.
Physics and Chemistry dominated public perception of science for a long time.
Daytoday life of man was influenced by developments in Physics, Chemistry and their respective
manufacturing industries. Slowly and steadily, Biology, not to be left behind, demonstrated
its utility for human welfare. Medical practice, especially diagnostics, green revolution and
the newly emerging biotechnology and its success stories made the presence of biology felt
by the common man. Patent laws brought biology into political domain and commercial value
of biology became obvious.
For more than a century, classical and so-called reductionist biology fought artifical
battles. The fact is both are important. Ecology brought in synthesis of both approaches
and emphasised integrated understanding of biology. Form and process are both equally
important. Systems biology, using mathematical tools, is bringing about a modern synthesis
of both the aspects of Biology.
The Class XI and XII textbooks in biology essentially were to reflect these threads of
biological thought. While the Class XI book dealt with morphology, taxonomy, molecular and
cellular aspects of physiology, the Class XII book deals with the physiological process of
reproduction in flowering plants and humans, the principles of inheritance, the nature of
genetic material and its function, the contributions of biology to human welfare, basic
principles of biotechnological processes and their applications and achievements. The
Class XII book also relates genes to evolution on one hand and presents ecological interactions,
behaviour of populations and ecosystems on the other. Most important, the guidelines under
NCF-2005 have been followed in letter and spirit. The total learning load has been reduced
Vconsiderably and themes like environmental issues, adolescent problems and reproductive
health have been dealt with in some detail. Studied together, the class XI and class XII
textbooks in Biology would enable the student to —
(i) become familiar with the diversity of biological material.
(ii) appreciate and believe in the Darwinian evolutionary process exhibited by the living
world.
(iii) understand the dynamic state of constituents of living bodies, i.e., metabolic
basis of all physiological processes in plants, animals and microbes.
(iv) realise the structure and function of genetic material in directing the inherited
phenotype pattern as well as a mediator of evolutionary process.
(v) appreciate the profound contributions of biology to human welfare.
(vi) reflect on the physico-chemical basis of living processes and at the same time
realise the limitation of reductionism in understanding behaviour of organisms.
(vii) experience the humbling effect of this realisation that all living organisms are
related to each other by virtue of shared genetic material.
(viii) realise that biology is the story of the struggle of living organisms for existence
and survival.
One may notice a perceptible change in the writing style. Most of the chapters are written
in an easy dialogue style engaging the student constantly while some chapters are in the
form of critical comments on the subject matter. A number of questions have been provided
at the end of each chapter though answers to some may not be found in the text. Students
have to read supplementary material, upon advise from the teacher, to answer such questions.
I am thankful to Professor Krishna Kumar, Director NCERT; Professor G. Ravindra, Joint
Director, NCERT and Professor Hukum Singh, Head, DESM, NCERT for constant support. I
must place on record my deep appreciation for Dr B.K. Tripathi, Reader, DESM, NCERT for
his relentless efforts as coordinator in bringing out the Biology textbook for both the
Class XI and XII. All the members of the development team, the experts and reviewers, and
the school teachers have contributed enormously in the preparation of this book. I thank
them all. I am indeed highly thankful to the members of monitoring committee constituted
by Ministry of Human Resource Development for their valuable observation that helped in
the improvement of the book at the final stage. The book is prepared keeping in mind the
guidelines of the NCF-2005 especially the emphasis on reducing the learning load. We hope that
the book would meet the expectations of all the stakeholders. All suggestions for further
improvement are always welcome.

Reproductive Health
Biology in essence is the story of life on earth. While individual
organisms die without fail, species continue to live through
millions of years unless threatened by natural or anthropogenic
extinction. Reproduction becomes a vital process without
which species cannot survive for long. Each individual leaves
its progeny by asexual or sexual means. Sexual mode of
reproduction enables creation of new variants, so that survival
advantage is enhanced. This unit examines the general
principles underlying reproductive processes in living organisms
and then explains the details of this process in flowering plants
and humans as easy to relate representative examples. A related
perspective on human reproductive health and how
reproductive ill health can be avoided is also presented to
complete our understanding of biology of reproduction.
2017-18P ANCHANAN M AHESHWARI
(1904-1966)
Born in November 1904 in Jaipur (Rajasthan) Panchanan Maheshwari
rose to become one of the most distinguished botanists not only of India
but of the entire world. He moved to Allahabad for higher education
where he obtained his D.Sc. During his college days, he was inspired
by Dr W. Dudgeon, an American missionary teacher, to develop interest
in Botany and especially morphology. His teacher once expressed that
if his student progresses ahead of him, it will give him a great satisfaction.
These words encouraged Panchanan to enquire what he could do for
his teacher in return.
He worked on embryological aspects and popularised the use of
embryological characters in taxonomy. He established the Department
of Botany, University of Delhi as an important centre of research in
embryology and tissue culture. He also emphasised the need for initiation
of work on artificial culture of immature embryos. These days, tissue
culture has become a landmark in science. His work on test tube
fertilisation and intra-ovarian pollination won worldwide acclaim.
He was honoured with fellowship of Royal Society of London (FRS),
Indian National Science Academy and several other institutions of
excellence. He encouraged general education and made a significant
contribution to school education by his leadership in bringing out the
very first textbooks of Biology for Higher Secondary Schools published
by NCERT in 1964.

REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS
1.1 Asexual
Reproduction
1.2 Sexual
Reproduction
Each and every organism can live only for a certain period
of time. The period from birth to the natural death of an
organism represents its life span. Life spans of a few
organisms are given in Figure 1.1. Several other organisms
are drawn for which you should find out their life spans
and write in the spaces provided. Examine the life spans
of organisms represented in the Figure 1.1. Isn’t it both
interesting and intriguing to note that it may be as short
as a few days or as long as a few thousand years? Between
these two extremes are the life spans of most other living
organisms. You may note that life spans of organisms are
not necessarily correlated with their sizes; the sizes of
crows and parrots are not very different yet their life spans
show a wide difference. Similarly, a mango tree has a much
shorter life span as compared to a peepal tree. Whatever
be the life span, death of every individual organism is a
certainty, i.e., no individual is immortal, except single-celled
organisms. Why do we say there is no natural death in
single-celled organisms? Given this reality, have you ever
wondered how vast number of plant and animal species
have existed on earth for several thousands of years? There
must be some processes in living organisms that ensure
this continuity. Yes, we are talking about reproduction,
something that we take for granted.

2017-18REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS
Reproduction is defined as a biological process in which an
organism gives rise to young ones (offspring) similar to itself. The offspring
grow, mature and in turn produce new offspring. Thus, there is a cycle
of birth, growth and death. Reproduction enables the continuity of the
species, generation after generation. You will study later in Chapter 5
(Principles of Inheritance and Variation) how genetic variation is created
and inherited during reproduction.
There is a large diversity in the biological world and each organism
has evolved its own mechanism to multiply and produce offspring.
The organism’s habitat, its internal physiology and several other factors
are collectively responsible for how it reproduces. Based on whether
there is participation of one organism or two in the process of
reproduction, it is of two types. When offspring is produced by a single
parent with or without the involvement of gamete formation, the
reproduction is asexual. When two parents (opposite sex) participate in
the reproductive process and also involve fusion of male and female
gametes, it is called sexual reproduction.
1.1 A SEXUAL R EPRODUCTION
In this method, a single individual (parent) is capable of producing
offspring. As a result, the offspring that are produced are not only
identical to one another but are also exact copies of their parent.
Are these offspring likely to be genetically identical or different?
The term clone is used to describe such morphologically and
genetically similar individuals.

Let us see how widespread asexual reproduction is, among different
groups of organisms. Asexual reproduction is common among
single-celled organisms, and in plants and animals with relatively simple
organisations. In Protists and Monerans, the organism or the parent
cell divides into two to give rise to new individuals (Figure1.2). Thus,

in these organisms cell division is itself a mode of reproduction.
Many single-celled organisms reproduce by binary fission, where a
cell divides into two halves and each rapidly grows into an adult (e.g.,
Amoeba, Paramecium). In yeast, the division is unequal and small
buds are produced that remain attached initially to the parent cell
which, eventually gets separated and mature into new yeast
organisms (cells). (Please see Page 287 also)
Members of the Kingdom Fungi and simple plants such as algae
reproduce through special asexual reproductive structures (Figure 1.3).
The most common of these structures are zoospores that usually are
microscopic motile structures. Other common asexual reproductive
structures are conidia (Penicillium), buds (Hydra) and gemmules (sponge).

You have learnt about vegetative reproduction in plants in Class XI.
What do you think – Is vegetative reproduction also a type of asexual
reproduction? Why do you say so? Is the term clone applicable to the
offspring formed by vegetative reproduction?
While in animals and other simple organisms the term asexual is used
unambiguously, in plants, the term vegetative reproduction is frequently
used. In plants, the units of vegetative propagation such as runner,
rhizome, sucker, tuber, offset, bulb are all capable of giving rise to new
offspring (Figure1.4). These structures are called vegetative propagules.
Obviously, since the formation of these structures does not involve two
parents, the process involved is asexual. (Please see Page 287 also)

2017-18BIOLOGY
You must have heard about the scourge of the water bodies or about
the ‘terror of Bengal’. This is nothing but the aquatic plant ‘water hyacinth’
which is one of the most invasive weeds found growing wherever there is
standing water. It drains oxygen from the water, which leads to death of
fishes. You will learn more about it in Chapters 13 and 14. You may find
it interesting to know that this plant was introduced in India because of
its beautiful flowers and shape of leaves. Since it can propagate vegetatively
at a phenomenal rate and spread all over the water body in a short period
of time, it is very difficult to get rid off them.
Are you aware how plants like potato, sugarcane, banana, ginger,
dahlia are cultivated? Have you seen small plants emerging from the
buds (called eyes) of the potato tuber, from the rhizomes of banana and
ginger? When you carefully try to determine the site of origin of the new
plantlets in the plants listed above, you will notice that they invariably
arise from the nodes present in the modified stems of these plants. When
the nodes come in contact with damp soil or water, they produce roots
and new plants. Similarly, adventitious buds arise from the notches
present at margins of leaves of Bryophyllum. This ability is fully exploited
by gardeners and farmers for commercial propagation of such plants.
It is interesting to note that asexual reproduction is the common method
of reproduction in organisms that have a relatively simple organisation,
like algae and fungi and that they shift to sexual method of reproduction
just before the onset of adverse conditions. Find out how sexual
reproduction enables these organisms to survive during unfavourable
conditions? Why is sexual reproduction favoured under such conditions?
Asexual (vegetative) as well as sexual modes of reproduction are exhibited
by the higher plants. On the other hand, only sexual mode of reproduction
is present in most of the animals.
1.2 S EXUAL R EPRODUCTION
8
Sexual reproduction involves formation of the male and female gametes,
either by the same individual or by different individuals of the opposite
sex. These gametes fuse to form the zygote which develops to form the
new organism. It is an elaborate, complex and slow process as compared
to asexual reproduction. Because of the fusion of male and female gametes,
sexual reproduction results in offspring that are not identical to the parents
or amongst themselves.
A study of diverse organisms–plants, animals or fungi –show that
though they differ so greatly in external morphology, internal structure
and physiology, when it comes to sexual mode of reproduction,
surprisingly, they share a similar pattern. Let us first discuss what features
are common to these diverse organisms.
All organisms have to reach a certain stage of growth and maturity in
their life, before they can reproduce sexually. That period of growth is
2017-18REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS
called the juvenile phase. It is known as vegetative phase in plants.
This phase is of variable durations in different organisms.
The end of juvenile/vegetative phase which marks the beginning of
the reproductive phase can be seen easily in the higher plants when they
come to flower. How long does it take for marigold/rice/wheat/coconut/
mango plants to come to flower? In some plants, where flowering occurs
more than once, what would you call the inter-flowering period – juvenile
or mature?
Observe a few trees in your area. Do they flower during the same
month year after year? Why do you think the availability of fruits like
mango, apple, jackfruit, etc., is seasonal? Are there some plants that flower
throughout the year and some others that show seasonal flowering?
Plants –the annual and biennial types, show clear cut vegetative,
reproductive and senescent phases, but in the perennial species it is very
difficult to clearly define these phases. A few plants exhibit unusual
flowering phenomenon; some of them such as bamboo species flower only
once in their life time, generally after 50-100 years, produce large number
of fruits and die. Another plant, Strobilanthus kunthiana (neelakuranji),
flowers once in 12 years. As many of you would know, this plant flowered
during September-October 2006. Its mass flowering transformed large
tracks of hilly areas in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu into blue
stretches and attracted a large number of tourists. In animals, the juvenile
phase is followed by morphological and physiological changes prior to
active reproductive behaviour. The reproductive phase is also of variable
duration in different organisms.
Can you list the changes seen in human beings that are indicative
of reproductive maturity?
Among animals, for example birds, do they lay eggs all through the
year? Or is it a seasonal phenomenon? What about other animals like
frogs and lizards? You will notice that, birds living in nature lay eggs only
seasonally. However, birds in captivity (as in poultry farms) can be made
to lay eggs throughout the year. In this case, laying eggs is not related to
reproduction but is a commercial exploitation for human welfare. The
females of placental mammals exhibit cyclical changes in the activities of
ovaries and accessory ducts as well as hormones during the reproductive
phase. In non-primate mammals like cows, sheep, rats, deers, dogs, tiger,
etc., such cyclical changes during reproduction are called oestrus cycle
where as in primates (monkeys, apes, and humans) it is called menstrual
cycle. Many mammals, especially those living in natural, wild conditions
exhibit such cycles only during favourable seasons in their reproductive
phase and are therefore called seasonal breeders. Many other mammals
are reproductively active throughout their reproductive phase and hence
are called continuous breeders.
That we all grow old (if we live long enough), is something that we
recognise. But what is meant by growing old? The end of reproductive
9
2017-18BIOLOGY
phase can be considered as one of the parameters of senescence or old
age. There are concomitant changes in the body (like slowing of
metabolism, etc.) during this last phase of life span. Old age ultimately
leads to death.
In both plants and animals, hormones are responsible for the
transitions between the three phases. Interaction between hormones and
certain environmental factors regulate the reproductive processes and
the associated behavioural expressions of organisms.
Events in sexual reproduction : After attainment of maturity, all sexually
reproducing organisms exhibit events and processes that have remarkable
fundamental similarity, even though the structures associated with sexual
reproduction are indeed very different. The events of sexual reproduction
though elaborate and complex, follow a regular sequence. Sexual
reproduction is characterised by the fusion (or fertilisation) of the male and
female gametes, the formation of zygote and embryogenesis. For convenience
these sequential events may be grouped into three distinct stages namely,
the pre-fertilisation, fertilisation and the post-fertilisation events.
1.2.1 Pre-fertilisation Events
These include all the events of sexual reproduction prior to the fusion of
gametes. The two main pre-fertilisation events are gametogenesis and
gamete transfer.
1.2.1.1 Gametogenesis
As you are already aware, gametogenesis refers to the process of formation
of the two types of gametes – male and female. Gametes are haploid
cells. In some algae the two gametes are so similar in appearance
that it is not possible to categorise them into male and female gametes.

Fucus (an alga); (c) Heterogametes of Homo sapiens (Human beings)
2017-18REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS
They are hence called homogametes (isogametes) (Figure 1.5a).
However, in a majority of sexually reproducing organisms the gametes
produced are of two morphologically distinct types (heterogametes). In
such organisms the male gamete is called the antherozoid or sperm
and the female gamete is called the egg or ovum (Figure1.5 b, c).
Sexuality in organisms: Sexual reproduction in organisms generally
involves the fusion of gametes from two different individuals. But this
is not always true. From your recollection of examples studied in
Class XI, can you identify cases where self-fertilisation is observed? Of
course, citing such examples in plants is easy.
Plants may have both male and female reproductive structures in the
same plant (bisexual) (Figure 1.6 c, e) or on different plants (unisexual)
(Figure 1.6 d). In several fungi and plants, terms such as homothallic
and monoecious are used to denote the bisexual condition and
heterothallic and dioecious are the terms used to describe unisexual
condition. In flowering plants, the unisexual male flower is staminate,
i.e., bearing stamens, while the female is pistillate or bearing pistils. In
some flowering plants, both male and female flowers may be present on
the same individual (monoecious) or on separate individuals (dioecious).
Some examples of monoecious plants are cucurbits and coconuts and of
dioecious plants are papaya and date palm. Name the type of gametes
that are formed in staminate and pistillate flowers.
But what about animals? Are individuals of all species either male or
female (unisexual)? Or are there species which possess both the
reproductive organs (bisexual)? You probably can make a list
of several unisexual animal species. Earthworms, (Figure 1.6 a) sponge,
tapeworm and leech, typical examples of bisexual animals that possess
both male and female reproductive organs, are hermaphrodites.
Cockroach (Figure 1.6b) is an example of a unisexual species.
Cell division during gamete formation : Gametes in all heterogametic
species are of two types namely, male and female. Gametes are haploid
though the parent plant body from which they arise may be either haploid
or diploid. A haploid parent produces gametes by mitotic division. Does
this mean that meiosis never occurs in organisms that are haploid?
Carefully examine the flow charts of life cycles of algae that you have
studied in Class XI (Chapter 3) to get a suitable answer.
Several organisms belonging to monera, fungi, algae and bryophytes
have haploid plant body, but in organisms belonging to pteridophytes,
gymnosperms, angiosperms and most of the animals including human
beings, the parental body is diploid. It is obvious that meiosis, the reduction
division, has to occur if a diploid body has to produce haploid gametes.
In diploid organisms, specialised cells called meiocytes (gamete mother
cell) undergo meiosis. At the end of meiosis, only one set of chromosomes

the diploid and haploid chromosome numbers of organisms. Is there any
relationship in the number of chromosomes of meiocytes and gametes?
1.2.1.2 Gamete Transfer
After their formation, male and female gametes must be physically
brought together to facilitate fusion (fertilisation). Have you ever
wondered how the gametes meet? In a majority of organisms, male
gamete is motile and the female gamete is stationary. Exceptions are a
few fungi and algae in which both types of gametes are motile
(Figure1.7a). There is a need for a medium through which the male
gametes move. In several simple plants like algae, bryophytes and
pteridophytes, water is the medium through which this gamete transfer
takes place. A large number of the male gametes, however, fail to reach
the female gametes. To compensate this loss of male gametes during
transport, the number of male gametes produced is several thousand
times the number of female gametes produced.
In seed plants, pollen grains are the carriers of male gametes and
ovule have the egg. Pollen grains produced in anthers therefore, have to
13
2017-18BIOLOGY
(a)
be transferred to the stigma before it can lead to
fertilisation (Figure 1.7b). In bisexual, self-fertilising
plants, e.g., peas, transfer of pollen grains to the stigma
is relatively easy as anthers and stigma are located close
to each other; pollen grains soon after they are shed,
come in contact with the stigma. But in cross
pollinating plants (including dioecious plants), a
specialised event called pollination facilitates transfer
of pollen grains to the stigma. Pollen grains germinate
on the stigma and the pollen tubes carrying the male
gametes reach the ovule and discharge male gametes
near the egg. In dioecious animals, since male and
female gametes are formed in different individuals, the
organism must evolve a special mechanism for gamete
transfer. Successful transfer and coming together of
gametes is essential for the most critical event in sexual
reproduction, the fertilisation.
1.2.2 Fertilisation
The most vital event of sexual reproduction is perhaps
the fusion of gametes. This process called syngamy
results in the formation of a diploid zygote. The term
fertilisation is also often used for this process. The
terms syngamy and fertilisation are frequently used
though , interchangeably.
What would happen if syngamy does not occur?
However, it has to be mentioned here that in some
organisms like rotifers, honeybees and even some lizards
(b)
and birds (turkey), the female gamete undergoes
Figure 1.7 (a) Homogametic contact in
alga; (b) Germinating pollen development to form new organisms without fertilisation.
grains on the stigma of a flower This phenomenon is called parthenogenesis.
14
Where does syngamy occur? In most aquatic
organisms, such as a majority of algae and fishes as well as amphibians,
syngamy occurs in the external medium (water), i.e., outside the body of
the organism. This type of gametic fusion is called external fertilisation.
Organisms exhibiting external fertilisation show great synchrony between
the sexes and release a large number of gametes into the surrounding
medium (water) in order to enhance the chances of syngamy. This happens
in the bony fishes and frogs where a large number of offspring are
produced. A major disadvantage is that the offspring are extremely
vulnerable to predators threatening their survival up to adulthood.
In many terrestrial organisms, belonging to fungi, higher animals such
as reptiles, birds, mammals and in a majority of plants (bryophytes,
pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms), syngamy occurs inside
2017-18REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS
the body of the organism, hence the process is called internal fertilisation.
In all these organisms, egg is formed inside the female body where they
fuse with the male gamete. In organisms exhibiting internal fertilisation,
the male gamete is motile and has to reach the egg in order to fuse with it.
In these even though the number of sperms produced is very large, there
is a significant reduction in the number of eggs produced. In seed plants,
however, the non-motile male gametes are carried to female gamete by
pollen tubes.
1.2.3 Post-fertilisation Events
Events in sexual reproduction after the formation of zygote are called
post-fertilisation events.
1.2.3.1 The Zygote
Formation of the diploid zygote is universal in all sexually reproducing
organisms. In organisms with external fertilisation, zygote is formed in
the external medium (usually water), whereas in those exhibiting internal
fertilisation, zygote is formed inside the body of the organism.
Further development of the zygote depends on the type of life cycle
the organism has and the environment it is exposed to. In organisms
belonging to fungi and algae, zygote develops a thick wall that is resistant
to dessication and damage. It undergoes a period of rest before
germination. In organisms with haplontic life cycle (As you have read
in Class XI), zygote divides by meiosis to form haploid spores that grow
into haploid individuals. Consult your Class XI book and find out what
kind of development takes place in the zygote in organisms with diplontic
and haplo-diplontic life cycles.
Zygote is the vital link that ensures continuity of species
between organisms of one generation and the next. Every sexually
reproducing organism, including human beings begin life as a single
cell–the zygote.
1.2.3.2 Embryogenesis
Embryogenesis refers to the process of development of embryo from the
zygote. During embryogenesis, zygote undergoes cell division (mitosis)
and cell differentiation. While cell divisions increase the number of cells
in the developing embryo; cell differentiation helps groups of cells to
undergo certain modifications to form specialised tissues and organs to
form an organism. You have studied about the process of cell division
and differentiation in the previous class.
Animals are categorised into oviparous and viviparous based on
whether the development of the zygote takes place outside the body of the
female parent or inside, i.e., whether they lay fertilised/unfertilised eggs
or give birth to young ones. In oviparous animals like reptiles and birds,
15
2017-18BIOLOGY
the fertilised eggs covered by hard calcareous shell are laid in a safe
place in the environment; after a period of incubation young ones hatch
out. On the other hand, in viviparous animals (majority of mammals
including human beings), the zygote develops into a young one inside
the body of the female organism. After attaining a certain stage of growth,
the young ones are delivered out of the body of the female organism.
Because of proper embryonic care and protection, the chances of survival
of young ones is greater in viviparous organisms.
In flowering plants, the zygote is formed inside the ovule. After
fertilisation the sepals, petals and stamens of the flower wither and fall
off. Can you name a plant in which the sepals remain attached? The
pistil however, remains attached to the plant. The zygote develops into
the embryo and the ovules develop into the seed. The ovary develops into
the fruit which develops a thick wall called pericarp that is protective in
function (Figure 1.8). After dispersal, seeds germinate under favourable
conditions to produce new plants.
Figure 1.8 A few kinds of fruit showing seeds (S) and
protective pericarp (P)
SUMMARY
16
Reproduction enables a species to live generation after generation.
Reproduction in organisms can be broadly classified into asexual and
sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction does not involve the fusion
of gametes. It is common in organisms that have a relatively simple
organisation such as the fungi, algae and some invertebrate animals.
The offspring formed by asexual reproduction are identical and can be
referred to as clones. Zoospores, conidia, etc., are the most common
asexual structures formed in several algae and fungi. Budding and
gemmule formation are the common asexual methods seen in animals.
Prokaryotes and unicellular organisms reproduce asexually by
cell division or binary fission of the parent cell. In several aquatic and
terrestrial species of angiosperms, structures such as runners,
2017-18REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS
rhizomes, suckers, tubers, offsets, etc., are capable of giving rise to
new offspring. This method of asexual reproduction is generally
referred to as vegetative propagation.
Sexual reproduction involves the formation and fusion of gametes.
It is a complex and slower process as compared to asexual reproduction.
Most of the higher animals reproduce almost entirely by sexual method.
Events of sexual reproduction may be categorised into pre-fertilisation,
fertilisation and post-fertilisation events. Pre-fertilisation events include
gametogenesis and gamete transfer while post-fertilisation events
include the formation of zygote and embryogenesis.
Organisms may be bisexual or unisexual. Sexuality in plants is
varied, particularly in angiosperms, due to the production of diverse
types of flowers. Plants are defined as monoecious and dioecious.
Flowers may be bisexual or unisexual flowers.
Gametes are haploid in nature and usually a direct product of meiotic
division except in haploid organisms where gametes are formed by mitosis.
Transfer of male gametes is an essential event in sexual reproduction.
It is relatively easy in bisexual organisms. In unisexual animals it occurs
by copulation or simultaneous release. In angiosperms, a special process
called pollination ensures transfer of pollen grains which carry the pollen
grains to the stigma.
Syngamy (fertilisation) occurs between the male and female gametes.
Syngamy may occur either externally, outside the body of organisms or
internally, inside the body. Syngamy leads to formation of a specialised
cell called zygote.
The process of development of embryo from the zygote is called
embryogenesis. In animals, the zygote starts developing soon after its
formation. Animals may be either oviparous or viviparous. Embryonal
protection and care are better in viviparous organisms.
In flowering plants, after fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and
ovules mature into seeds. Inside the mature seed is the progenitor of
the next generation, the embryo.

Reproductive Health
Biology in essence is the story of life on earth. While individual
organisms die without fail, species continue to live through
millions of years unless threatened by natural or anthropogenic
extinction. Reproduction becomes a vital process without
which species cannot survive for long. Each individual leaves
its progeny by asexual or sexual means. Sexual mode of
reproduction enables creation of new variants, so that survival
advantage is enhanced. This unit examines the general
principles underlying reproductive processes in living organisms
and then explains the details of this process in flowering plants
and humans as easy to relate representative examples. A related
perspective on human reproductive health and how
reproductive ill health can be avoided is also presented to
complete our understanding of biology of reproduction.

(1904-1966)
Born in November 1904 in Jaipur (Rajasthan) Panchanan Maheshwari
rose to become one of the most distinguished botanists not only of India
but of the entire world. He moved to Allahabad for higher education
where he obtained his D.Sc. During his college days, he was inspired
by Dr W. Dudgeon, an American missionary teacher, to develop interest
in Botany and especially morphology. His teacher once expressed that
if his student progresses ahead of him, it will give him a great satisfaction.
These words encouraged Panchanan to enquire what he could do for
his teacher in return.
He worked on embryological aspects and popularised the use of
embryological characters in taxonomy. He established the Department
of Botany, University of Delhi as an important centre of research in
embryology and tissue culture. He also emphasised the need for initiation
of work on artificial culture of immature embryos. These days, tissue
culture has become a landmark in science. His work on test tube
fertilisation and intra-ovarian pollination won worldwide acclaim.
He was honoured with fellowship of Royal Society of London (FRS),
Indian National Science Academy and several other institutions of
excellence. He encouraged general education and made a significant
contribution to school education by his leadership in bringing out the
very first textbooks of Biology for Higher Secondary Schools published
by NCERT in 1964.

Reproduction
1.2 Sexual
Reproduction
Each and every organism can live only for a certain period
of time. The period from birth to the natural death of an
organism represents its life span. Life spans of a few
organisms are given in Figure 1.1. Several other organisms
are drawn for which you should find out their life spans
and write in the spaces provided. Examine the life spans
of organisms represented in the Figure 1.1. Isn’t it both
interesting and intriguing to note that it may be as short
as a few days or as long as a few thousand years? Between
these two extremes are the life spans of most other living
organisms. You may note that life spans of organisms are
not necessarily correlated with their sizes; the sizes of
crows and parrots are not very different yet their life spans
show a wide difference. Similarly, a mango tree has a much
shorter life span as compared to a peepal tree. Whatever
be the life span, death of every individual organism is a
certainty, i.e., no individual is immortal, except single-celled
organisms. Why do we say there is no natural death in
single-celled organisms? Given this reality, have you ever
wondered how vast number of plant and animal species
have existed on earth for several thousands of years? There
must be some processes in living organisms that ensure
this continuity. Yes, we are talking about reproduction,
something that we take for granted.

2017-18REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS
Reproduction is defined as a biological process in which an
organism gives rise to young ones (offspring) similar to itself. The offspring
grow, mature and in turn produce new offspring. Thus, there is a cycle
of birth, growth and death. Reproduction enables the continuity of the
species, generation after generation. You will study later in Chapter 5
(Principles of Inheritance and Variation) how genetic variation is created
and inherited during reproduction.
There is a large diversity in the biological world and each organism
has evolved its own mechanism to multiply and produce offspring.
The organism’s habitat, its internal physiology and several other factors
are collectively responsible for how it reproduces. Based on whether
there is participation of one organism or two in the process of
reproduction, it is of two types. When offspring is produced by a single
parent with or without the involvement of gamete formation, the
reproduction is asexual. When two parents (opposite sex) participate in
the reproductive process and also involve fusion of male and female
gametes, it is called sexual reproduction.
1.1 A SEXUAL R EPRODUCTION
In this method, a single individual (parent) is capable of producing
offspring. As a result, the offspring that are produced are not only
identical to one another but are also exact copies of their parent.
Are these offspring likely to be genetically identical or different?
The term clone is used to describe such morphologically and
genetically similar individuals.

Let us see how widespread asexual reproduction is, among different
groups of organisms. Asexual reproduction is common among
single-celled organisms, and in plants and animals with relatively simple
organisations. In Protists and Monerans, the organism or the parent
cell divides into two to give rise to new individuals (Figure1.2). Thus,

Figure1.3 Asexual reproductive structures: (a) Zoospores of Chlamydomonas; (b) Conidia of
Penicillium; (c) Buds in Hydra ; (d) Gemmules in sponge
6
in these organisms cell division is itself a mode of reproduction.
Many single-celled organisms reproduce by binary fission, where a
cell divides into two halves and each rapidly grows into an adult (e.g.,
Amoeba, Paramecium). In yeast, the division is unequal and small
buds are produced that remain attached initially to the parent cell
which, eventually gets separated and mature into new yeast
organisms (cells). (Please see Page 287 also)
Members of the Kingdom Fungi and simple plants such as algae
reproduce through special asexual reproductive structures (Figure 1.3).
The most common of these structures are zoospores that usually are
microscopic motile structures. Other common asexual reproductive
structures are conidia (Penicillium), buds (Hydra) and gemmules (sponge).

You have learnt about vegetative reproduction in plants in Class XI.
What do you think – Is vegetative reproduction also a type of asexual
reproduction? Why do you say so? Is the term clone applicable to the
offspring formed by vegetative reproduction?
While in animals and other simple organisms the term asexual is used
unambiguously, in plants, the term vegetative reproduction is frequently
used. In plants, the units of vegetative propagation such as runner,
rhizome, sucker, tuber, offset, bulb are all capable of giving rise to new
offspring (Figure1.4). These structures are called vegetative propagules.
Obviously, since the formation of these structures does not involve two
parents, the process involved is asexual. (Please see Page 287 also)

You must have heard about the scourge of the water bodies or about
the ‘terror of Bengal’. This is nothing but the aquatic plant ‘water hyacinth’
which is one of the most invasive weeds found growing wherever there is
standing water. It drains oxygen from the water, which leads to death of
fishes. You will learn more about it in Chapters 13 and 14. You may find
it interesting to know that this plant was introduced in India because of
its beautiful flowers and shape of leaves. Since it can propagate vegetatively
at a phenomenal rate and spread all over the water body in a short period
of time, it is very difficult to get rid off them.
Are you aware how plants like potato, sugarcane, banana, ginger,
dahlia are cultivated? Have you seen small plants emerging from the
buds (called eyes) of the potato tuber, from the rhizomes of banana and
ginger? When you carefully try to determine the site of origin of the new
plantlets in the plants listed above, you will notice that they invariably
arise from the nodes present in the modified stems of these plants. When
the nodes come in contact with damp soil or water, they produce roots
and new plants. Similarly, adventitious buds arise from the notches
present at margins of leaves of Bryophyllum. This ability is fully exploited
by gardeners and farmers for commercial propagation of such plants.
It is interesting to note that asexual reproduction is the common method
of reproduction in organisms that have a relatively simple organisation,
like algae and fungi and that they shift to sexual method of reproduction
just before the onset of adverse conditions. Find out how sexual
reproduction enables these organisms to survive during unfavourable
conditions? Why is sexual reproduction favoured under such conditions?
Asexual (vegetative) as well as sexual modes of reproduction are exhibited
by the higher plants. On the other hand, only sexual mode of reproduction
is present in most of the animals.
1.2 S EXUAL R EPRODUCTION
8
Sexual reproduction involves formation of the male and female gametes,
either by the same individual or by different individuals of the opposite
sex. These gametes fuse to form the zygote which develops to form the
new organism. It is an elaborate, complex and slow process as compared
to asexual reproduction. Because of the fusion of male and female gametes,
sexual reproduction results in offspring that are not identical to the parents
or amongst themselves.
A study of diverse organisms–plants, animals or fungi –show that
though they differ so greatly in external morphology, internal structure
and physiology, when it comes to sexual mode of reproduction,
surprisingly, they share a similar pattern. Let us first discuss what features
are common to these diverse organisms.
All organisms have to reach a certain stage of growth and maturity in
their life, before they can reproduce sexually. That period of growth is
2017-18REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS
called the juvenile phase. It is known as vegetative phase in plants.
This phase is of variable durations in different organisms.
The end of juvenile/vegetative phase which marks the beginning of
the reproductive phase can be seen easily in the higher plants when they
come to flower. How long does it take for marigold/rice/wheat/coconut/
mango plants to come to flower? In some plants, where flowering occurs
more than once, what would you call the inter-flowering period – juvenile
or mature?
Observe a few trees in your area. Do they flower during the same
month year after year? Why do you think the availability of fruits like
mango, apple, jackfruit, etc., is seasonal? Are there some plants that flower
throughout the year and some others that show seasonal flowering?
Plants –the annual and biennial types, show clear cut vegetative,
reproductive and senescent phases, but in the perennial species it is very
difficult to clearly define these phases. A few plants exhibit unusual
flowering phenomenon; some of them such as bamboo species flower only
once in their life time, generally after 50-100 years, produce large number
of fruits and die. Another plant, Strobilanthus kunthiana (neelakuranji),
flowers once in 12 years. As many of you would know, this plant flowered
during September-October 2006. Its mass flowering transformed large
tracks of hilly areas in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu into blue
stretches and attracted a large number of tourists. In animals, the juvenile
phase is followed by morphological and physiological changes prior to
active reproductive behaviour. The reproductive phase is also of variable
duration in different organisms.
Can you list the changes seen in human beings that are indicative
of reproductive maturity?
Among animals, for example birds, do they lay eggs all through the
year? Or is it a seasonal phenomenon? What about other animals like
frogs and lizards? You will notice that, birds living in nature lay eggs only
seasonally. However, birds in captivity (as in poultry farms) can be made
to lay eggs throughout the year. In this case, laying eggs is not related to
reproduction but is a commercial exploitation for human welfare. The
females of placental mammals exhibit cyclical changes in the activities of
ovaries and accessory ducts as well as hormones during the reproductive
phase. In non-primate mammals like cows, sheep, rats, deers, dogs, tiger,
etc., such cyclical changes during reproduction are called oestrus cycle
where as in primates (monkeys, apes, and humans) it is called menstrual
cycle. Many mammals, especially those living in natural, wild conditions
exhibit such cycles only during favourable seasons in their reproductive
phase and are therefore called seasonal breeders. Many other mammals
are reproductively active throughout their reproductive phase and hence
are called continuous breeders.
That we all grow old (if we live long enough), is something that we
recognise. But what is meant by growing old? The end of reproductive
9
2017-18BIOLOGY
phase can be considered as one of the parameters of senescence or old
age. There are concomitant changes in the body (like slowing of
metabolism, etc.) during this last phase of life span. Old age ultimately
leads to death.
In both plants and animals, hormones are responsible for the
transitions between the three phases. Interaction between hormones and
certain environmental factors regulate the reproductive processes and
the associated behavioural expressions of organisms.
Events in sexual reproduction : After attainment of maturity, all sexually
reproducing organisms exhibit events and processes that have remarkable
fundamental similarity, even though the structures associated with sexual
reproduction are indeed very different. The events of sexual reproduction
though elaborate and complex, follow a regular sequence. Sexual
reproduction is characterised by the fusion (or fertilisation) of the male and
female gametes, the formation of zygote and embryogenesis. For convenience
these sequential events may be grouped into three distinct stages namely,
the pre-fertilisation, fertilisation and the post-fertilisation events.
1.2.1 Pre-fertilisation Events
These include all the events of sexual reproduction prior to the fusion of
gametes. The two main pre-fertilisation events are gametogenesis and
gamete transfer.
1.2.1.1 Gametogenesis
As you are already aware, gametogenesis refers to the process of formation
of the two types of gametes – male and female. Gametes are haploid
cells. In some algae the two gametes are so similar in appearance
that it is not possible to categorise them into male and female gametes.

They are hence called homogametes (isogametes) (Figure 1.5a).
However, in a majority of sexually reproducing organisms the gametes
produced are of two morphologically distinct types (heterogametes). In
such organisms the male gamete is called the antherozoid or sperm
and the female gamete is called the egg or ovum (Figure1.5 b, c).
Sexuality in organisms: Sexual reproduction in organisms generally
involves the fusion of gametes from two different individuals. But this
is not always true. From your recollection of examples studied in
Class XI, can you identify cases where self-fertilisation is observed? Of
course, citing such examples in plants is easy.
Plants may have both male and female reproductive structures in the
same plant (bisexual) (Figure 1.6 c, e) or on different plants (unisexual)
(Figure 1.6 d). In several fungi and plants, terms such as homothallic
and monoecious are used to denote the bisexual condition and
heterothallic and dioecious are the terms used to describe unisexual
condition. In flowering plants, the unisexual male flower is staminate,
i.e., bearing stamens, while the female is pistillate or bearing pistils. In
some flowering plants, both male and female flowers may be present on
the same individual (monoecious) or on separate individuals (dioecious).
Some examples of monoecious plants are cucurbits and coconuts and of
dioecious plants are papaya and date palm. Name the type of gametes
that are formed in staminate and pistillate flowers.
But what about animals? Are individuals of all species either male or
female (unisexual)? Or are there species which possess both the
reproductive organs (bisexual)? You probably can make a list
of several unisexual animal species. Earthworms, (Figure 1.6 a) sponge,
tapeworm and leech, typical examples of bisexual animals that possess
both male and female reproductive organs, are hermaphrodites.
Cockroach (Figure 1.6b) is an example of a unisexual species.
Cell division during gamete formation : Gametes in all heterogametic
species are of two types namely, male and female. Gametes are haploid
though the parent plant body from which they arise may be either haploid
or diploid. A haploid parent produces gametes by mitotic division. Does
this mean that meiosis never occurs in organisms that are haploid?
Carefully examine the flow charts of life cycles of algae that you have
studied in Class XI (Chapter 3) to get a suitable answer.
Several organisms belonging to monera, fungi, algae and bryophytes
have haploid plant body, but in organisms belonging to pteridophytes,
gymnosperms, angiosperms and most of the animals including human
beings, the parental body is diploid. It is obvious that meiosis, the reduction
division, has to occur if a diploid body has to produce haploid gametes.
In diploid organisms, specialised cells called meiocytes (gamete mother
cell) undergo meiosis. At the end of meiosis, only one set of chromosomes

the diploid and haploid chromosome numbers of organisms. Is there any
relationship in the number of chromosomes of meiocytes and gametes?
1.2.1.2 Gamete Transfer
After their formation, male and female gametes must be physically
brought together to facilitate fusion (fertilisation). Have you ever
wondered how the gametes meet? In a majority of organisms, male
gamete is motile and the female gamete is stationary. Exceptions are a
few fungi and algae in which both types of gametes are motile
(Figure1.7a). There is a need for a medium through which the male
gametes move. In several simple plants like algae, bryophytes and
pteridophytes, water is the medium through which this gamete transfer
takes place. A large number of the male gametes, however, fail to reach
the female gametes. To compensate this loss of male gametes during
transport, the number of male gametes produced is several thousand
times the number of female gametes produced.
In seed plants, pollen grains are the carriers of male gametes and
ovule have the egg. Pollen grains produced in anthers therefore, have to
13
2017-18BIOLOGY
(a)
be transferred to the stigma before it can lead to
fertilisation (Figure 1.7b). In bisexual, self-fertilising
plants, e.g., peas, transfer of pollen grains to the stigma
is relatively easy as anthers and stigma are located close
to each other; pollen grains soon after they are shed,
come in contact with the stigma. But in cross
pollinating plants (including dioecious plants), a
specialised event called pollination facilitates transfer
of pollen grains to the stigma. Pollen grains germinate
on the stigma and the pollen tubes carrying the male
gametes reach the ovule and discharge male gametes
near the egg. In dioecious animals, since male and
female gametes are formed in different individuals, the
organism must evolve a special mechanism for gamete
transfer. Successful transfer and coming together of
gametes is essential for the most critical event in sexual
reproduction, the fertilisation.
1.2.2 Fertilisation
The most vital event of sexual reproduction is perhaps
the fusion of gametes. This process called syngamy
results in the formation of a diploid zygote. The term
fertilisation is also often used for this process. The
terms syngamy and fertilisation are frequently used
though , interchangeably.
What would happen if syngamy does not occur?
However, it has to be mentioned here that in some
organisms like rotifers, honeybees and even some lizards
(b)
and birds (turkey), the female gamete undergoes
Figure 1.7 (a) Homogametic contact in
alga; (b) Germinating pollen development to form new organisms without fertilisation.
grains on the stigma of a flower This phenomenon is called parthenogenesis.
14
Where does syngamy occur? In most aquatic
organisms, such as a majority of algae and fishes as well as amphibians,
syngamy occurs in the external medium (water), i.e., outside the body of
the organism. This type of gametic fusion is called external fertilisation.
Organisms exhibiting external fertilisation show great synchrony between
the sexes and release a large number of gametes into the surrounding
medium (water) in order to enhance the chances of syngamy. This happens
in the bony fishes and frogs where a large number of offspring are
produced. A major disadvantage is that the offspring are extremely
vulnerable to predators threatening their survival up to adulthood.
In many terrestrial organisms, belonging to fungi, higher animals such
as reptiles, birds, mammals and in a majority of plants (bryophytes,
pteridophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms), syngamy occurs inside
2017-18REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS
the body of the organism, hence the process is called internal fertilisation.
In all these organisms, egg is formed inside the female body where they
fuse with the male gamete. In organisms exhibiting internal fertilisation,
the male gamete is motile and has to reach the egg in order to fuse with it.
In these even though the number of sperms produced is very large, there
is a significant reduction in the number of eggs produced. In seed plants,
however, the non-motile male gametes are carried to female gamete by
pollen tubes.
1.2.3 Post-fertilisation Events
Events in sexual reproduction after the formation of zygote are called
post-fertilisation events.
1.2.3.1 The Zygote
Formation of the diploid zygote is universal in all sexually reproducing
organisms. In organisms with external fertilisation, zygote is formed in
the external medium (usually water), whereas in those exhibiting internal
fertilisation, zygote is formed inside the body of the organism.
Further development of the zygote depends on the type of life cycle
the organism has and the environment it is exposed to. In organisms
belonging to fungi and algae, zygote develops a thick wall that is resistant
to dessication and damage. It undergoes a period of rest before
germination. In organisms with haplontic life cycle (As you have read
in Class XI), zygote divides by meiosis to form haploid spores that grow
into haploid individuals. Consult your Class XI book and find out what
kind of development takes place in the zygote in organisms with diplontic
and haplo-diplontic life cycles.
Zygote is the vital link that ensures continuity of species
between organisms of one generation and the next. Every sexually
reproducing organism, including human beings begin life as a single
cell–the zygote.
1.2.3.2 Embryogenesis
Embryogenesis refers to the process of development of embryo from the
zygote. During embryogenesis, zygote undergoes cell division (mitosis)
and cell differentiation. While cell divisions increase the number of cells
in the developing embryo; cell differentiation helps groups of cells to
undergo certain modifications to form specialised tissues and organs to
form an organism. You have studied about the process of cell division
and differentiation in the previous class.
Animals are categorised into oviparous and viviparous based on
whether the development of the zygote takes place outside the body of the
female parent or inside, i.e., whether they lay fertilised/unfertilised eggs
or give birth to young ones. In oviparous animals like reptiles and birds,
15
2017-18BIOLOGY
the fertilised eggs covered by hard calcareous shell are laid in a safe
place in the environment; after a period of incubation young ones hatch
out. On the other hand, in viviparous animals (majority of mammals
including human beings), the zygote develops into a young one inside
the body of the female organism. After attaining a certain stage of growth,
the young ones are delivered out of the body of the female organism.
Because of proper embryonic care and protection, the chances of survival
of young ones is greater in viviparous organisms.
In flowering plants, the zygote is formed inside the ovule. After
fertilisation the sepals, petals and stamens of the flower wither and fall
off. Can you name a plant in which the sepals remain attached? The
pistil however, remains attached to the plant. The zygote develops into
the embryo and the ovules develop into the seed. The ovary develops into
the fruit which develops a thick wall called pericarp that is protective in
function (Figure 1.8). After dispersal, seeds germinate under favourable
conditions to produce new plants.
Figure 1.8 A few kinds of fruit showing seeds (S) and
protective pericarp (P)
SUMMARY
16
Reproduction enables a species to live generation after generation.
Reproduction in organisms can be broadly classified into asexual and
sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction does not involve the fusion
of gametes. It is common in organisms that have a relatively simple
organisation such as the fungi, algae and some invertebrate animals.
The offspring formed by asexual reproduction are identical and can be
referred to as clones. Zoospores, conidia, etc., are the most common
asexual structures formed in several algae and fungi. Budding and
gemmule formation are the common asexual methods seen in animals.
Prokaryotes and unicellular organisms reproduce asexually by
cell division or binary fission of the parent cell. In several aquatic and
terrestrial species of angiosperms, structures such as runners,
2017-18REPRODUCTION IN ORGANISMS
rhizomes, suckers, tubers, offsets, etc., are capable of giving rise to
new offspring. This method of asexual reproduction is generally
referred to as vegetative propagation.
Sexual reproduction involves the formation and fusion of gametes.
It is a complex and slower process as compared to asexual reproduction.
Most of the higher animals reproduce almost entirely by sexual method.
Events of sexual reproduction may be categorised into pre-fertilisation,
fertilisation and post-fertilisation events. Pre-fertilisation events include
gametogenesis and gamete transfer while post-fertilisation events
include the formation of zygote and embryogenesis.
Organisms may be bisexual or unisexual. Sexuality in plants is
varied, particularly in angiosperms, due to the production of diverse
types of flowers. Plants are defined as monoecious and dioecious.
Flowers may be bisexual or unisexual flowers.
Gametes are haploid in nature and usually a direct product of meiotic
division except in haploid organisms where gametes are formed by mitosis.
Transfer of male gametes is an essential event in sexual reproduction.
It is relatively easy in bisexual organisms. In unisexual animals it occurs
by copulation or simultaneous release. In angiosperms, a special process
called pollination ensures transfer of pollen grains which carry the pollen
grains to the stigma.
Syngamy (fertilisation) occurs between the male and female gametes.
Syngamy may occur either externally, outside the body of organisms or
internally, inside the body. Syngamy leads to formation of a specialised
cell called zygote.
The process of development of embryo from the zygote is called
embryogenesis. In animals, the zygote starts developing soon after its
formation. Animals may be either oviparous or viviparous. Embryonal
protection and care are better in viviparous organisms.
In flowering plants, after fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and
ovules mature into seeds. Inside the mature seed is the progenitor of
the next generation, the embryo.

Are we not lucky that plants reproduce sexually? The
myriads of flowers that we enjoy gazing at, the scents and
the perfumes that we swoon over, the rich colours that
attract us, are all there as an aid to sexual reproduction.
Flowers do not exist only for us to be used for our own
selfishness. All flowering plants show sexual reproduction.
A look at the diversity of structures of the inflorescences,
flowers and floral parts, shows an amazing range of
adaptations to ensure formation of the end products of
sexual reproduction, the fruits and seeds. In this chapter,
let us understand the morphology, structure and the
processes of sexual reproduction in flowering plants
(angiosperms).

flowers since time immemorial. Flowers are objects of
aesthetic, ornamental, social, religious and cultural value
– they have always been used as symbols for conveying
important human feelings such as love, affection,
happiness, grief, mourning, etc. List at least five flowers

To a biologist, flowers are morphological and embryological marvels
and the sites of sexual reproduction. In class XI, you have read the various
parts of a flower. Figure 2.1 will help you recall the parts of a typical
flower. Can you name the two parts in a flower in which the two most
important units of sexual reproduction develop?

Much before the actual flower is seen on a plant, the decision that the plant
is going to flower has taken place. Several hormonal and structural changes
are initiated which lead to the differentiation and further development of
the floral primordium. Inflorescences are formed which bear the floral buds
and then the flowers. In the flower the male and female reproductive
structures, the androecium and the gynoecium differentiate and develop.
You would recollect that the androecium consists of a whorl of stamens
representing the male reproductive organ and the gynoecium represents
the female reproductive organ.SEXUAL

2.2.1 Stamen, Microsporangium and Pollen Grain
Figure 2.2a shows the two parts of a typical stamen – the long and slender
stalk called the filament, and the terminal generally bilobed structure
called the anther. The proximal end of the filament
is attached to the thalamus or the petal of the flower.
The number and length of stamens are variable in
flowers of different species. If you were to collect a
stamen each from ten flowers (each from different
species) and arrange them on a slide, you would
be able to appreciate the large variation in size seen
in nature. Careful observation of each stamen
under a dissecting microscope and making neat
diagrams would elucidate the range in shape and
attachment of anthers in different flowers.
A typical angiosperm anther is bilobed with
each lobe having two theca, i.e., they are dithecous
(Figure 2.2 b). Often a longitudinal groove runs
lengthwise separating the theca. Let us
understand the various types of tissues and their
organisation in the transverse section of an anther
(Figure 2.3 a). The bilobed nature of an anther is
very distinct in the transverse section of the anther.
The anther is a four-sided (tetragonal) structure
consisting of four microsporangia located at the
(b)
corners, two in each lobe.
The microsporangia develop further and
(a)
become pollen sacs. They extend longitudinally
all through the length of an anther and are packed Figure 2.2 (a) A typical stamen;
with pollen grains.
(b) three–dimensional cut section
of an anther
Structure of microsporangium: In a transverse
section, a typical microsporangium appears near
circular in outline. It is generally surrounded by four wall layers (Figure
2.3 b)– the epidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum. The
outer three wall layers perform the function of protection and help in
dehiscence of anther to release the pollen. The innermost wall layer is
the tapetum. It nourishes the developing pollen grains. Cells of the
tapetum possess dense cytoplasm and generally have more than one
nucleus. Can you think of how tapetal cells could become bi-nucleate?
21
When the anther is young, a group of compactly arranged homogenous
cells called the sporogenous tissue occupies the centre of each
microsporangium.
Microsporogenesis : As the anther develops, the cells of the sporogenous
tissue undergo meiotic divisions to form microspore tetrads. What would
be the ploidy of the cells of the tetrad?BIOLOGY
22
As each cell of the sporogenous tissue is capable of giving rise to a
microspore tetrad. Each one is a potential pollen or microspore mother
cell. The process of formation of microspores from a pollen mother cell (PMC)
through meiosis is called microsporogenesis. The microspores, as they
are formed, are arranged in a cluster of four cells–the microspore tetrad
(Figure 2.3 a). As the anthers mature and dehydrate, the microspores
dissociate from each other and develop into pollen grains (Figure 2.3 b).
Inside each microsporangium several thousands of microspores or pollen
grains are formed that are released with the dehiscence of anther
(Figure 2.3 c).
Pollen grain: The pollen grains represent the male gametophytes. If you
touch the opened anthers of Hibiscus or any other flower you would find
deposition of yellowish powdery pollen grains on your fingers. Sprinkle
these grains on a drop of water taken on a glass slide and observe underSEXUAL

Figure 2.4 Scanning electron micrographs of a few pollen grains

a microscope. You will really be amazed at the variety of architecture –
sizes, shapes, colours, designs – seen on the pollen grains
from different species (Figure 2.4).
Pollen grains are generally spherical measuring about
25-50 micrometers in diameter. It has a prominent two-layered
wall. The hard outer layer called the exine is made up of
sporopollenin which is one of the most resistant organic material
known. It can withstand high temperatures and strong acids
and alkali. No enzyme that degrades sporopollenin is so far
known. Pollen grain exine has prominent apertures called germ
pores where sporopollenin is absent. Pollen grains are well-
preserved as fossils because of the presence of sporopollenin.
The exine exhibits a fascinating array of patterns and designs.
Why do you think the exine should be hard? What is the
function of germ pore? The inner wall of the pollen grain is
called the intine. It is a thin and continuous layer made up of
cellulose and pectin. The cytoplasm of pollen grain is
surrounded by a plasma membrane. When the pollen grain is
mature it contains two cells, the vegetative cell and generative
cell (Figure 2.5b). The vegetative cell is bigger, has abundant
food reserve and a large irregularly shaped nucleus. The
(b)
generative cell is small and floats in the cytoplasm of the
Figure 2.5 (a) Enlarged view of
vegetative cell. It is spindle shaped with dense cytoplasm and
a pollen grain tetrad; (b) stages
a nucleus. In over 60 per cent of angiosperms, pollen grains
of a microspore maturing into a
are shed at this 2-celled stage. In the remaining species, the
pollen grain
generative cell divides mitotically to give rise to the two male
23
gametes before pollen grains are shed (3-celled stage).
Pollen grains of many species cause severe allergies and bronchial
afflictions in some people often leading to chronic respiratory
disorders – asthma, bronchitis, etc. It may be mentioned that Parthenium
or carrot grass that came into India as a contaminant with imported wheat,
has become ubiquitous in occurrence and causes pollen allergy.BIOLOGY
Pollen grains are rich in nutrients. It has become a fashion in recent
years to use pollen tablets as food supplements. In western countries, a
large number of pollen products in the form of tablets and syrups are
available in the market. Pollen consumption has been claimed to increase
the performance of athletes and race horses (Figure 2.6).
Figure 2.6 Pollen products
When once they are shed, pollen grains have to land on the stigma
before they lose viability if they have to bring about fertilisation. How long
do you think the pollen grains retain viability? The period for which pollen
grains remain viable is highly variable and to some extent depends on the
prevailing temperature and humidity. In some cereals such as rice and
wheat, pollen grains lose viability within 30 minutes of their release, and
in some members of Rosaceae, Leguminoseae and Solanaceae, they
maintain viability for months. You may have heard of storing semen/
sperms of many animals including humans for artificial insemination. It
is possible to store pollen grains of a large number of species for years in
liquid nitrogen (-196 0 C). Such stored pollen can be used as pollen banks,
similar to seed banks, in crop breeding programmes.
2.2.2 The Pistil, Megasporangium (ovule) and Embryo sac
24
The gynoecium represents the female reproductive part of the flower. The
gynoecium may consist of a single pistil (monocarpellary) or may have
more than one pistil (multicarpellary). When there are more than one,
the pistils may be fused together (syncarpous) (Figure 2.7b) or may be
free (apocarpous) (Figure 2.7c). Each pistil has three parts (Figure 2.7a),
the stigma, style and ovary. The stigma serves as a landing platform
for pollen grains. The style is the elongated slender part beneath the
stigma. The basal bulged part of the pistil is the ovary. Inside the ovary
is the ovarian cavity (locule). The placenta is located inside the ovarian
cavity. Recall the definition and types of placentation that you studied inSEXUAL

Class XI. Arising from the placenta are the megasporangia, commonly
called ovules. The number of ovules in an ovary may be one (wheat,
paddy, mango) to many (papaya, water melon, orchids).
The Megasporangium (Ovule) : Let us familiarise ourselves with the
structure of a typical angiosperm ovule (Figure 2.7d). The ovule is a small
structure attached to the placenta by means of a stalk called funicle.
The body of the ovule fuses with funicle in the region called hilum. Thus,
hilum represents the junction between ovule and funicle. Each ovule has
one or two protective envelopes called integuments. Integuments encircle
the nucellus except at the tip where a small opening called the micropyle
is organised. Opposite the micropylar end, is the chalaza, representing
the basal part of the ovule.
Enclosed within the integuments is a mass of cells called the nucellus.
Cells of the nucellus have abundant reserve food materials. Located in the
nucellus is the embryo sac or female gametophyte. An ovule generally has
a single embryo sac formed from a megaspore.
Megasporogenesis : The process of formation of megaspores from the
megaspore mother cell is called megasporogenesis. Ovules generally
differentiate a single megaspore mother cell (MMC) in the micropylar region

of the nucellus. It is a large cell containing dense cytoplasm and a
prominent nucleus. The MMC undergoes meiotic division. What is the
importance of the MMC undergoing meiosis? Meiosis results in the
production of four megaspores (Figure 2.8a).
Female gametophyte : In a majority of flowering plants, one of the
megaspores is functional while the other three degenerate. Only the
functional megaspore develops into the female gametophyte (embryo
sac). This method of embryo sac formation from a single megaspore is termed
monosporic development. What will be the ploidy of the cells of the nucellus,
MMC, the functional megaspore and female gametophyte?SEXUAL
IN FLOWERING PLANTS
H UMAN REPRODUCTION
R EPRODUCTION
Let us study formation of the embryo sac in a little more detail.
(Figure 2.8b). The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically
to form two nuclei which move to the opposite poles, forming the
2-nucleate embryo sac. Two more sequential mitotic nuclear divisions
result in the formation of the 4-nucleate and later the 8-nucleate stages
of the embryo sac. It is of interest to note that these mitotic divisions are
strictly free nuclear, that is, nuclear divisions are not followed immediately
by cell wall formation. After the 8-nucleate stage, cell walls are laid down
leading to the organisation of the typical female gametophyte
or embryo sac. Observe the distribution of cells inside the embryo sac
(Figure 2.8b, c). Six of the eight nuclei are surrounded by cell walls and
organised into cells; the remaining two nuclei, called polar nuclei are
situated below the egg apparatus in the large central cell.
There is a characteristic distribution of the cells within the embryo
sac. Three cells are grouped together at the micropylar end and constitute
the egg apparatus. The egg apparatus, in turn, consists of two synergids
and one egg cell. The synergids have special cellular thickenings at the
micropylar tip called filiform apparatus, which play an important role in
guiding the pollen tubes into the synergid. Three cells are at the chalazal
end and are called the antipodals. The large central cell, as mentioned
earlier, has two polar nuclei. Thus, a typical angiosperm embryo sac, at
maturity, though 8-nucleate is 7-celled.
2.2.3 Pollination
In the preceding sections you have learnt that the male and female gametes
in flowering plants are produced in the pollen grain and embryo sac,
respectively. As both types of gametes are non-motile, they have to be
brought together for fertilisation to occur. How is this achieved?
Pollination is the mechanism to achieve this objective. Transfer
of pollen grains (shed from the anther) to the stigma of a pistil is
termed pollination. Flowering plants have evolved an amazing array
of adaptations to achieve pollination. They make use of external
agents to achieve pollination. Can you list the possible external
agents?
Kinds of Pollination : Depending on the source of pollen, pollination
can be divided into three types.
(i)
Autogamy : In this type, pollination is achieved within the same
flower. Transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the
same flower (Figure 2.9a). In a normal flower which opens and
exposes the anthers and the stigma, complete autogamy is rather
rare. Autogamy in such flowers requires synchrony in pollen release
and stigma receptivity and also, the anthers and the stigma should
27BIOLOGY
lie close to each other so that self-pollination
can occur. Some plants such as Viola
(common pansy), Oxalis, and Commelina
produce two types of flowers –
chasmogamous flowers which are similar to
flowers of other species with exposed anthers
and stigma, and cleistogamous flowers which
do not open at all (Figure 2.9c). In such flowers,
the anthers and stigma lie close to each other.
When anthers dehisce in the flower buds,
pollen grains come in contact with the stigma
to effect pollination. Thus, cleistogamous
flowers are invariably autogamous as there is
no chance of cross-pollen landing on the
stigma. Cleistogamous flowers produce
assured seed-set even in the absence of
pollinators. Do you think that cleistogamy is
advantageous or disadvantageous to the
plant? Why?

(ii) Geitonogamy – Transfer of pollen grains from
the anther to the stigma of another flower of
the same plant. Although geitonogamy is
functionally cross-pollination involving a
pollinating agent, genetically it is similar to
autogamy since the pollen grains come from
the same plant.
(iii) Xenogamy – Transfer of pollen grains from
anther to the stigma of a different plant (Figure
2.9b). This is the only type of pollination which
during pollination brings genetically different
types of pollen grains to the stigma.
Agents of Pollination : Plants use two abiotic (wind
and water) and one biotic (animals) agents to achieve
pollination. Majority of plants use biotic agents for
pollination. Only a small proportion of plants use
abiotic agents. Pollen grains coming in contact with
the stigma is a chance factor in both wind and water
pollination. To compensate for this uncertainties and
associated loss of pollen grains, the flowers produce
enormous amount of pollen when compared to the
number of ovules available for pollination.SEXUAL
IN FLOWERING PLANTS
H UMAN REPRODUCTION
R EPRODUCTION
Pollination by wind is more common
amongst abiotic pollinations. Wind pollination
also requires that the pollen grains are light
and non-sticky so that they can be
transported in wind currents. They often
possess well-exposed stamens (so that the
pollens are easily dispersed into wind currents,
Figure 2.10) and large often-feathery stigma
to easily trap air-borne pollen grains. Wind-
pollinated flowers often have a single ovule in
each ovary and numerous flowers packed into
an inflorescence; a familiar example is the corn
cob – the tassels you see are nothing but the
stigma and style which wave in the wind to
trap pollen grains. Wind-pollination is quite
common in grasses.
Pollination by water is quite rare in
flowering plants and is limited to about 30
genera, mostly monocotyledons. As against
this, you would recall that water is a regular
mode of transport for the male gametes among
the lower plant groups such as algae,
bryophytes and pteridophytes. It is believed,
Figure 2.10 A wind-pollinated plant showing
particularly for some bryophytes and
compact inflorecence and well-
pteridophytes, that their distribution is limited
exposed stamens
because of the need for water for the transport
of male gametes and fertilisation. Some
examples of water pollinated plants are Vallisneria and Hydrilla which
grow in fresh water and several marine sea-grasses such as Zostera. Not
all aquatic plants use water for pollination. In a majority of aquatic plants
such as water hyacinth and water lily, the flowers emerge above the level
of water and are pollinated by insects or wind as in most of the land
plants. In Vallisneria, the female flower reach the surface of water by the
long stalk and the male flowers or pollen grains are released on to the
surface of water. They are carried passively by water currents (Figure
2.11a); some of them eventually reach the female flowers and the stigma.
In another group of water pollinated plants such as seagrasses, female
flowers remain submerged in water and the pollen grains are released
29
inside the water. Pollen grains in many such species are long, ribbon like
and they are carried passively inside the water; some of them reach the
stigma and achieve pollination. In most of the water-pollinated species,
pollen grains are protected from wetting by a mucilaginous covering.
Both wind and water pollinated flowers are not very colourful and do
not produce nectar. What would be the reason for this?BIOLOGY
Majority of flowering plants use
a range of animals as pollinating
agents. Bees, butterflies, flies,
beetles, wasps, ants, moths, birds
(sunbirds and humming birds) and
bats are the common pollinating
agents. (Figure 2.11b). Among the
animals, insects, particularly bees
are the dominant biotic pollinating
agents. Even larger animals such
as some primates (lemurs), arboreal
(tree-dwelling) rodents, or even
reptiles (gecko lizard and garden
lizard) have also been reported as
pollinators in some species.
Often flowers of animal-
(a)
pollinated plants are specifically
adapted for a particular species of
animal.
Majority of insect-pollinated
flowers are large, colourful, fragrant
and rich in nectar. When the flowers
are small, a number of flowers are
clustered into an inflorescence to
make them conspicuous. Animals
are attracted to flowers by colour
and/or fragrance. The flowers
pollinated by flies and beetles
secrete foul odours to attract these
animals. To sustain animal visits,
the flowers have to provide rewards
to the animals. Nectar and pollen
grains are the usual floral rewards.
For harvesting the reward(s) from

in contact with the anthers and the

stigma. The body of the animal gets
a coating of pollen grains, which are
generally

in
animal
pollinated
flowers.
When the animal carrying
30
pollen on its body comes in contact with the stigma, it brings about
pollination.
In some species floral rewards are in providing safe places to lay eggs;
an example is that of the tallest flower of Amorphophallus (the flower
itself is about 6 feet in height). A similar relationship exists between a
species of moth and the plant Yucca where both species – moth and theSEXUAL
IN FLOWERING PLANTS

R EPRODUCTION
plant – cannot complete their life cycles without each other. The moth
deposits its eggs in the locule of the ovary and the flower, in turn, gets
pollinated by the moth. The larvae of the moth come out of the eggs as
the seeds start developing.
Why don’t you observe some flowers of the following plants (or any
others available to you): Cucumber, Mango, Peepal, Coriander, Papaya,
Onion, Lobia, Cotton, Tobacco, Rose, Lemon, Eucalyptus, Banana? Try to
find out which animals visit them and whether they could be
pollinators.You’ll have to patiently observe the flowers over a few days
and at different times of the day. You could also try to see whether there
is any correlation in the characteristics of a flower to the animal that
visits it. Carefully observe if any of the visitors come in contact with the
anthers and the stigma as only such visitors can bring about pollination.
Many insects may consume pollen or the nectar without bringing about
pollination. Such floral visitors are referred to as pollen/nectar robbers.
You may or may not be able to identify the pollinators, but you will surely
enjoy your efforts!
Outbreeding Devices : Majority of flowering plants produce hermaphrodite
flowers and pollen grains are likely to come in contact with the stigma of
the same flower. Continued self-pollination result in inbreeding depression.
Flowering plants have developed many devices to discourage self-
pollination and to encourage cross-pollination. In some species, pollen
release and stigma receptivity are not synchronised. Either the pollen is
released before the stigma becomes receptive or stigma becomes receptive
much before the release of pollen. In some other species, the anther and
stigma are placed at different positions so that the pollen cannot come in
contact with the stigma of the same flower. Both these devices prevent
autogamy. The third device to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility.
This is a genetic mechanism and prevents self-pollen (from the same flower
or other flowers of the same plant) from fertilising the ovules by inhibiting
pollen germination or pollen tube growth in the pistil. Another device to
prevent self-pollination is the production of unisexual flowers. If both male
and female flowers are present on the same plant such as castor and maize
(monoecious), it prevents autogamy but not geitonogamy. In several species
such as papaya, male and female flowers are present on different plants,
that is each plant is either male or female (dioecy). This condition prevents
both autogamy and geitonogamy.
Pollen-pistil Interaction : Pollination does not guarantee the transfer
of the right type of pollen (compatible pollen of the same species as the
stigma). Often, pollen of the wrong type, either from other species or from
the same plant (if it is self-incompatible), also land on the stigma. The
pistil has the ability to recognise the pollen, whether it is of the right type
(compatible) or of the wrong type (incompatible). If it is of the right type,
the pistil accepts the pollen and promotes post-pollination events that

egg apparatus showing entry of pollen tube into a synergid; (e) Discharge of male
gametes into a synergid and the movements of the sperms, one into the egg and
the other into the central cell
leads to fertilisation. If the pollen is of the wrong type, the pistil rejects the
pollen by preventing pollen germination on the stigma or the pollen tube
growth in the style. The ability of the pistil to recognise the pollen followed
by its acceptance or rejection is the result of a continuous dialogue
between pollen grain and the pistil. This dialogue is mediated by chemical
components of the pollen interacting with those of the pistil. It is only in
recent years that botanists have been able to identify some of the pollen
and pistil components and the interactions leading to the recognition,
followed by acceptance or rejection.
As mentioned earlier, following compatible pollination, the pollen grain
germinates on the stigma to produce a pollen tube through one of the
germ pores (Figure 2.12a). The contents of the pollen grain move into theSEXUAL
IN FLOWERING PLANTS
H UMAN REPRODUCTION
R EPRODUCTION
pollen tube. Pollen tube grows through the tissues of the stigma and
style and reaches the ovary (Figure 2.12b, c). You would recall that in
some plants, pollen grains are shed at two-celled condition (a vegetative
cell and a generative cell). In such plants, the generative cell divides and
forms the two male gametes during the growth of pollen tube in the stigma.
In plants which shed pollen in the three-celled condition, pollen tubes
carry the two male gametes from the beginning. Pollen tube, after reaching
the ovary, enters the ovule through the micropyle and then enters one of
the synergids through the filiform apparatus (Figure 2.12d, e). Many recent
studies have shown that filiform apparatus present at the micropylar part
of the synergids guides the entry of pollen tube. All these events–from
pollen deposition on the stigma until pollen tubes enter the ovule–are
together referred to as pollen-pistil interaction. As pointed out earlier,
pollen-pistil interaction is a dynamic process involving pollen recognition
followed by promotion or inhibition of the pollen. The knowledge gained
in this area would help the plant breeder in manipulating pollen-pistil
interaction, even in incompatible pollinations, to get desired hybrids.
You can easily study pollen germination by dusting some pollen from
flowers such as pea, chickpea, Crotalaria, balsam and Vinca on a glass slide
containing a drop of sugar solution (about 10 per cent). After about 15–30
minutes, observe the slide under the low power lens of the microscope. You
are likely to see pollen tubes coming out of the pollen grains.
As you shall learn in the chapter on plant breeding (Chapter 9), a
breeder is interested in crossing different species and often genera to
combine desirable characters to produce commercially ‘superior’ varieties.
Artificial hybridisation is one of the major approaches of crop
improvement programme. In such crossing experiments it is important
to make sure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination
and the stigma is protected from contamination (from unwanted pollen).
This is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques.
If the female parent bears bisexual flowers, removal of anthers from
the flower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps is
necessary. This step is referred to as emasculation. Emasculated flowers
have to be covered with a bag of suitable size, generally made up of butter
paper, to prevent contamination of its stigma with unwanted pollen. This
process is called bagging. When the stigma of bagged flower attains
receptivity, mature pollen grains collected from anthers of the male parent
are dusted on the stigma, and the flowers are rebagged, and the fruits
allowed to develop.
If the female parent produces unisexual flowers, there is no need for
emasculation. The female flower buds are bagged before the flowers open.
When the stigma becomes receptive, pollination is carried out using the
desired pollen and the flower rebagged.
33BIOLOGY
2.3 D OUBLE F ERTILISATION
After entering one of the synergids, the pollen tube releases the two male
gametes into the cytoplasm of the synergid. One of the male gametes
moves towards the egg cell and fuses with its nucleus thus completing the
syngamy. This results in the formation of a diploid cell, the zygote. The
other male gamete moves towards the two polar nuclei located in the central
cell and fuses with them to produce a triploid primary endosperm nucleus
(PEN) (Figure 2.13a). As this involves the fusion of three haploid nuclei it
is termed triple fusion. Since two types of fusions, syngamy and triple
fusion take place in an embryo sac the phenomenon is termed double
fertilisation, an event unique to flowering plants. The central cell after
triple fusion becomes the primary endosperm cell (PEC) and develops
into the endosperm while the zygote develops into an embryo.

Following double fertilisation, events of endosperm and embryo
development, maturation of ovule(s) into seed(s) and ovary into fruit, are
collectively termed post-fertilisation events.
2.4.1 Endosperm
Endosperm development precedes embryo development. Why? The
primary endosperm cell divides repeatedly and forms a triploidSEXUAL
IN FLOWERING PLANTS
H UMAN REPRODUCTION
R EPRODUCTION
endosperm tissue. The cells of this tissue are filled with
reserve food materials and are used for the nutrition of
the developing embryo. In the most common type of
endosperm development, the PEN undergoes successive
nuclear divisions to give rise to free nuclei. This stage of
endosperm development is called free-nuclear endosperm.
Subsequently cell wall formation occurs and the
endosperm becomes cellular. The number of free nuclei
formed before cellularisation varies greatly. The coconut
water from tender coconut that you are familiar with, is
nothing but free-nuclear endosperm (made up of
thousands of nuclei) and the surrounding white kernel is
the cellular endosperm.
Endosperm may either be completely consumed by the
developing embryo (e.g., pea, groundnut, beans) before seed
maturation or it may persist in the mature seed (e.g. castor
and coconut) and be used up during seed germination. Split
open some seeds of castor, peas, beans, groundnut, fruit of
coconut and look for the endosperm in each case. Find out
whether the endosperm is persistent in cereals – wheat, rice
and maize.
(a)
2.4.2 Embryo
Embryo develops at the micropylar end of the embryo sac where
the zygote is situated. Most zygotes divide only after certain
amount of endosperm is formed. This is an adaptation to
provide assured nutrition to the developing embryo. Though
the seeds differ greatly, the early stages of embryo development
(embryogeny) are similar in both monocotyledons and
dicotyledons. Figure 2.13 depicts the stages of embryogeny in
a dicotyledonous embryo. The zygote gives rise to the
proembryo and subsequently to the globular, heart-shaped
and mature embryo.
(b)
A typical dicotyledonous embryo (Figure 2.14a), consists
of an embryonal axis and two cotyledons. The portion of Figure 2.14 (a) A typical dicot
embryo; (b) L.S. of an
embryonal axis above the level of cotyledons is the epicotyl,
embryo of grass
which terminates with the plumule or stem tip. The cylindrical
portion below the level of cotyledons is hypocotyl that
terminates at its lower end in the radicle or root tip. The root
35
tip is covered with a root cap.
Embryos of monocotyledons (Figure 2.14 b) possess only
one cotyledon. In the grass family the cotyledon is called
scutellum that is situated towards one side (lateral) of the
embryonal axis. At its lower end, the embryonal axis has theBIOLOGY
radical and root cap enclosed in an undifferentiated sheath called
coleorrhiza. The portion of the embryonal axis above the level of
attachment of scutellum is the epicotyl. Epicotyl has a shoot apex and a
few leaf primordia enclosed in a hollow foliar structure, the coleoptile.
Soak a few seeds in water (say of wheat, maize, peas, chickpeas,
ground nut) overnight. Then split the seeds and observe the various
parts of the embryo and the seed.
2.4.3 Seed
36
In angiosperms, the seed is the final product of sexual reproduction. It is
often described as a fertilised ovule. Seeds are formed inside fruits. A
seed typically consists of seed coat(s), cotyledon(s) and an embryo axis.
The cotyledons (Figure 2.15a) of the embryo are simple structures,
generally thick and swollen due to storage of food reserves (as in legumes).
Mature seeds may be non-albuminous or ex-albuminous. Non-
albuminous seeds have no residual endosperm as it is completely
consumed during embryo development (e.g., pea, groundnut).
Albuminous seeds retain a part of endosperm as it is not completely used
up during embryo development (e.g., wheat, maize, barley, castor).
Occasionally, in some seeds such as black pepper and beet, remnants of
nucellus are also persistent. This residual, persistent nucellus is the
perisperm.
Integuments of ovules harden as tough protective seed coats
(Figure 2.15a). The micropyle remains as a small pore in the seed coat.
This facilitates entry of oxygen and water into the seed during germination.
As the seed matures, its water content is reduced and seeds become
relatively dry (10-15 per cent moisture by mass). The general metabolic
activity of the embryo slows down. The embryo may enter a state of
inactivity called dormancy, or if favourable conditions are available
(adequate moisture, oxygen and suitable temperature), they germinate.
As ovules mature into seeds, the ovary develops into a fruit, i.e., the
transformation of ovules into seeds and ovary into fruit proceeds
simultaneously. The wall of the ovary develops into the wall of fruit called
pericarp. The fruits may be fleshy as in guava, orange, mango, etc., or
may be dry, as in groundnut, and mustard, etc. Many fruits have evolved
mechanisms for dispersal of seeds. Recall the classification of fruits and
their dispersal mechanisms that you have studied in an earlier class. Is
there any relationship between number of ovules in an ovary and the
number of seeds present in a fruit?
In most plants, by the time the fruit develops from the ovary, other
floral parts degenerate and fall off. However, in a few species such as apple,
strawberry, cashew, etc., the thalamus also contributes to fruit formation.
Such fruits are called false fruits (Figure 2.15b). Most fruits however
develop only from the ovary and are called true fruits. Although in most
of the species, fruits are the results of fertilisation, there are a few speciesSEXUAL
IN FLOWERING PLANTS
H UMAN REPRODUCTION

(b)
Figure 2.15 (a) Structure of some seeds. (b) False fruits of apple and strawberry
in which fruits develop without fertilisation. Such fruits are called
parthenocarpic fruits. Banana is one such example. Parthenocarpy can
be induced through the application of growth hormones and such fruits
are seedless.
Seeds offer several advantages to angiosperms. Firstly, since
reproductive processes such as pollination and fertilisation are
independent of water, seed formation is more dependable. Also seeds have
better adaptive strategies for dispersal to new habitats and help the species
37BIOLOGY
to colonise in other areas. As they have sufficient food reserves, young
seedlings are nourished until they are capable of photosynthesis on their
own. The hard seed coat provides protection to the young embryo. Being
products of sexual reproduction, they generate new genetic combinations
leading to variations.
Seed is the basis of our agriculture. Dehydration and dormancy of
mature seeds are crucial for storage of seeds which can be used as food
throughout the year and also to raise crop in the next season. Can you
imagine agriculture in the absence of seeds, or in the presence of seeds
which germinate straight away soon after formation and cannot be stored?
How long do the seeds remain alive after they are dispersed? This
period again varies greatly. In a few species the seeds lose viability within
a few months. Seeds of a large number of species live for several years.
Some seeds can remain alive for hundreds of years. There are several
records of very old yet viable seeds. The oldest is that of a lupine, Lupinus
arcticus excavated from Arctic Tundra. The seed germinated and flowered
after an estimated record of 10,000 years of dormancy. A recent record of
2000 years old viable seed is of the date palm, Phoenix dactylifera
discovered during the archeological excavation at King Herod’s palace
near the Dead Sea.
After completing a brief account of sexual reproduction of flowering
plants it would be worth attempting to comprehend the enormous
reproductive capacity of some flowering plants by asking the following
questions: How many eggs are present in an embryo sac? How many
embryo sacs are present in an ovule? How many ovules are present in
an ovary? How many ovaries are present in a typical flower? How many
flowers are present on a tree? And so on...
Can you think of some plants in which fruits contain very large
number of seeds. Orchid fruits are one such category and each fruit
contain thousands of tiny seeds. Similar is the case in fruits of some
parasitic species such as Orobanche and Striga. Have you seen a tiny
seed of Ficus? How large is the tree of Ficus developed from that tiny
seed. How many billions of seeds does each Ficus tree produce? Can
you imagine any other example in which such a tiny structure can
produce such a large biomass over the years?
2.5 A POMIXIS
38
AND
P OLYEMBRYONY
Although seeds, in general are the products of fertilisation, a few flowering
plants such as some species of Asteraceae and grasses, have evolved a
special mechanism, to produce seeds without fertilisation, called apomixis.
What is fruit production without fertilisation called? Thus, apomixis is a
form of asexual reproduction that mimics sexual reproduction. There are
several ways of development of apomictic seeds. In some species, the
diploid egg cell is formed without reduction division and develops into
the embryo without fertilisation. More often, as in many Citrus and Mango
varieties some of the nucellar cells surrounding the embryo sac start
dividing, protrude into the embryo sac and develop into the embryos. InSEXUAL

such species each ovule contains many embryos. Occurrence of more
than one embryo in a seed is referred to as polyembryony. Take out
some seeds of orange and squeeze them. Observe the many embryos of
different sizes and shapes from each seed. Count the number of embryos
in each seed. What would be the genetic nature of apomictic embryos?
Can they be called clones?
Hybrid varieties of several of our food and vegetable crops are being
extensively cultivated. Cultivation of hybrids has tremendously increased
productivity. One of the problems of hybrids is that hybrid seeds have
to be produced every year. If the seeds collected from hybrids are sown,
the plants in the progeny will segregate and do not maintain hybrid
characters. Production of hybrid seeds is costly and hence the cost of
hybrid seeds become too expensive for the farmers. If these hybrids are
made into apomicts, there is no segregation of characters in the hybrid
progeny. Then the farmers can keep on using the hybrid seeds to raise
new crop year after year and he does not have to buy hybrid seeds every
year. Because of the importance of apomixis in hybrid seed industry,
active research is going on in many laboratories around the world to
understand the genetics of apomixis and to transfer apomictic genes
into hybrid varieties.
SUMMARY
Flowers are the seat of sexual reproduction in angiosperms. In the flower,
androecium consisting of stamens represents the male reproductive
organs and gynoecium consisting of pistils represents the female
reproductive organs.
A typical anther is bilobed, dithecous and tetrasporangiate. Pollen
grains develop inside the microsporangia. Four wall layers, the
epidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum surround the
microsporangium. Cells of the sporogenous tissue lying in the centre of
the microsporangium, undergo meiosis (microsporogenesis) to form
tetrads of microspores. Individual microspores mature into pollen grains.
Pollen grains represents the male gametophytic generation. The
pollen grains have a two-layered wall, the outer exine and inner intine.
The exine is made up of sporopollenin and has germ pores. Pollen grains
may have two cells (a vegetative cell and generative cell) or three cells (a
vegetative cell and two male gametes) at the time of shedding.
The pistil has three parts – the stigma, style and the ovary. Ovules
are present in the ovary. The ovules have a stalk called funicle, protective
integument(s), and an opening called micropyle. The central tissue is
the nucellus in which the archesporium differentiates. A cell of the
archesporium, the megaspore mother cell divides meiotically and one of
the megaspores forms the embryo sac (the female gametophyte). The
mature embryo sac is 7-celled and 8-nucleate. At the micropylar end is
39BIOLOGY
the egg apparatus consisting of two synergids and an egg cell. At the
chalazal end are three antipodals. At the centre is a large central cell
with two polar nuclei.
Pollination is the mechanism to transfer pollen grains from the
anther to the stigma. Pollinating agents are either abiotic (wind and
water) or biotic (animals).
Pollen-pistil interaction involves all events from the landing of pollen
grains on the stigma until the pollen tube enters the embryo sac (when
the pollen is compatible) or pollen inhibition (when the pollen is
incompatible). Following compatible pollination, pollen grain germinates
on the stigma and the resulting pollen tube grow through the style,
enter the ovules and finally discharges two male gametes in one of the
synergids. Angiosperms exhibit double fertilisation because two fusion
events occur in each embryo sac, namely syngamy and triple fusion.
The products of these fusions are the diploid zygote and the triploid
primary endosperm nucleus (in the primary endosperm cell). Zygote
develops into the embryo and the primary endosperm cell forms the
endosperm tissue. Formation of endosperm always precedes
development of the embryo.
The developing embryo passes through different stages such as
the proembryo, globular and heart-shaped stages before maturation.
Mature dicotyledonous embryo has two cotyledons and an embryonal
axis with epicotyl and hypocotyl. Embryos of monocotyledons have a
single cotyledon. After fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and ovules
develop into seeds.
A phenomenon called apomixis is found in some angiosperms,
particularly in grasses. It results in the formation of seeds without
fertilisation. Apomicts have several advantages in horticulture and
agriculture.
Some angiosperms produce more than one embryo in their seed.
This phenomenon is called polyembryony.

topic – reproductive health. What do we understand by
this term? The term simply refers to healthy reproductive
organs with normal functions. However, it has a broader
perspective and includes the emotional and social aspects
of reproduction also. According to the World Health
Organisation (WHO), reproductive health means a total
well-being in all aspects of reproduction, i.e., physical,
emotional, behavioural and social. Therefore, a society with
people having physically and functionally normal
reproductive organs and normal emotional and behavioural
interactions among them in all sex-related aspects might
be called reproductively healthy. Why is it significant to
maintain reproductive health and what are the methods
taken up to achieve it? Let us examine them.

India was amongst the first countries in the world to
initiate action plans and programmes at a national level
to attain total reproductive health as a social goal.
These programmes called ‘family planning’ were
initiated in 1951 and were periodically assessed over
the past decades. Improved programmes covering widerBIOLOGY
58
reproduction-related areas are currently in operation under the
popular name ‘Reproductive and Child Health Care (RCH) programmes’.
Creating awareness among people about various reproduction related
aspects and providing facilities and support for building up a
reproductively healthy society are the major tasks under these
programmes.
With the help of audio-visual and the print-media governmental and
non-governmental agencies have taken various steps to create awareness
among the people about reproduction-related aspects. Parents, other
close relatives, teachers and friends, also have a major role in the
dissemination of the above information. Introduction of sex education
in schools should also be encouraged to provide right information to
the young so as to discourage children from believing in myths and
having misconceptions about sex-related aspects. Proper information
about reproductive organs, adolescence and related changes, safe and
hygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), AIDS,
etc., would help people, especially those in the adolescent age group to
lead a reproductively healthy life. Educating people, especially fertile
couples and those in marriageable age group, about available birth
control options, care of pregnant mothers, post-natal care of the mother
and child, importance of breast feeding, equal opportunities for the male
and the female child, etc., would address the importance of bringing up
socially conscious healthy families of desired size. Awareness of problems
due to uncontrolled population growth, social evils like sex-abuse and
sex-related crimes, etc., need to be created to enable people to think
and take up necessary steps to prevent them and thereby build up a
socially responsible and healthy society.
Successful implementation of various action plans to attain
reproductive health requires strong infrastructural facilities, professional
expertise and material support. These are essential to provide medical
assistance and care to people in reproduction-related problems like
pregnancy, delivery, STDs, abortions, contraception, menstrual problems,
infertility, etc. Implementation of better techniques and new strategies
from time to time are also required to provide more efficient care and
assistance to people. Statutory ban on amniocentesis (a foetal sex
determination test based on the chromosomal pattern in the amniotic
fluid surrounding the developing embryo) for sex-determination to legally
check increasing female foeticides, massive child immunisation, etc., are
some programmes that merit mention in this connection.
Research on various reproduction-related areas are encouraged and
supported by governmental and non-governmental agencies to find out
new methods and/or to improve upon the existing ones. Do you know
that ‘Saheli’–a new oral contraceptive for the females–was developed
by scientists at Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) in Lucknow, India?
Better awareness about sex related matters, increased number of medically
assisted deliveries and better post-natal care leading to decreased maternalREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
and infant mortality rates, increased number of couples with small
families, better detection and cure of STDs and overall increased medical
facilities for all sex-related problems, etc. all indicate improved reproductive
health of the society.
4.2 P OPULATION E XPLOSION
AND
B IRTH C ONTROL
In the last century an all-round development in various fields significantly
improved the quality of life of the people. However, increased health facilities
along with better living conditions had an explosive impact on the growth
of population. The world population which was around 2 billion
(2000 million) in 1900 rocketed to about 6 billions by 2000. A similar
trend was observed in India too. Our population which was approximately
350 million at the time of our independence reached close to the billion
mark by 2000 and crossed 1 billion in May 2000. That means, every
sixth person in the world is an Indian. A rapid decline in death rate,
maternal mortality rate (MMR) and infant mortality rate (IMR) as
well as an increase in number of people in reproducible age are probable
reasons for this. Through our RCH programmes, though we could bring
down the population growth rate, it was only marginal. According to the
2001 census report, the population growth rate was still around 1.7 per
cent, i.e., 17/1000/year, a rate at which our population could double in
33 years. Such an alarming growth rate could lead to an absolute scarcity
of even the basic requirements, i.e., food, shelter and clothing, in spite of
significant progress made in those areas. Therefore, the government was
forced to take up serious measures to check this population growth rate.
The most important step to overcome this problem is to motivate smaller
families by using various contraceptive methods. You might have seen
advertisements in the media as well as posters/bills, etc., showing a happy
couple with two children with a slogan Hum Do Hamare Do (we two, our
two). Many couples, mostly the young, urban, working ones have even
adopted an ‘one child norm’. Statutory raising of marriageable age of the
female to 18 years and that of males to 21 years, and incentives given to
couples with small families are two of the other measures taken to tackle
this problem. Let us describe some of the commonly used contraceptive
methods, which help prevent unwanted pregnancies.
An ideal contraceptive should be user-friendly, easily available,
effective and reversible with no or least side-effects. It also should in no
way interfere with the sexual drive, desire and/or the sexual act of the
user. A wide range of contraceptive methods are presently available which
could be broadly grouped into the following categories, namely
Natural/Traditional, Barrier, IUDs, Oral contraceptives, Injectables,
Implants and Surgical methods.
Natural methods work on the principle of avoiding chances of ovum
and sperms meeting. Periodic abstinence is one such method in which
the couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 10 to 17 of the menstrual
cycle when ovulation could be expected. As chances of fertilisation are
59BIOLOGY
very high during this period, it is called the fertile period. Therefore, by
abstaining from coitus during this period, conception could be prevented.
Withdrawal or coitus interruptus is another method in which the male
partner withdraws his penis from the vagina just before ejaculation so as
to avoid insemination. Lactational amenorrhea (absence of
menstruation) method is based on the fact that ovulation
and therefore the cycle do not occur during the period of
intense lactation following parturition. Therefore, as long
as the mother breast-feeds the child fully, chances of
conception are almost nil. However, this method has been
Figure 4.1(a) Condom for male
reported to be effective only upto a maximum period of six
months following parturition. As no medicines or devices
are used in these methods, side effects are almost nil.
Chances of failure, though, of this method are also high.
In barrier methods, ovum and sperms are prevented
from physically meeting with the help of barriers. Such
methods are available for both males and females.
Condoms (Figure 4.1 a, b) are barriers made of thin rubber/
latex sheath that are used to cover the penis in the male or
vagina and cervix in the female, just before coitus so that
Figure 4.1(b) Condom for female
the ejaculated semen would not enter into the female
reproductive tract. This can prevent conception. ‘Nirodh’ is
a popular brand of condom for the male. Use of condoms
has increased in recent years due to its additional benefit of
protecting the user from contracting STDs and AIDS. Both
the male and the female condoms are disposable, can be
self-inserted and thereby gives privacy to the user.
Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults are also barriers
made of rubber that are inserted into the female reproductive
tract to cover the cervix during coitus. They prevent
conception by blocking the entry of sperms through the
cervix. They are reusable. Spermicidal creams, jellies and
foams are usually used alongwith these barriers to increase
their contraceptive efficiency.
Another effective and popular method is the use of Intra
Uterine Devices (IUDs). These devices are inserted by
doctors or expert nurses in the uterus through vagina.
These Intra Uterine Devices are presently available as the
Figure 4.2. Copper T (CuT)
non-medicated IUDs (e.g., Lippes loop), copper releasing
IUDs (CuT, Cu7, Multiload 375) and the hormone releasing IUDs
(Progestasert, LNG-20) (Figure 4.2). IUDs increase phagocytosis of sperms
60
within the uterus and the Cu ions released suppress sperm motility
and the fertilising capacity of sperms. The hormone releasing IUDs,
in addition, make the uterus unsuitable for implantation and the
cervix hostile to the sperms. IUDs are ideal contraceptives for the femalesREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
who want to delay pregnancy and/or space children. It is
one of most widely accepted methods of contraception in
India.
Oral administration of small doses of either progestogens
or progestogen –estrogen combinations is another
contraceptive method used by the females. They are used
in the form of tablets and hence are popularly called the
pills. Pills have to be taken daily for a period of 21 days
starting preferably within the first five days of menstrual
cycle. After a gap of 7 days (during which menstruation
Figure 4.3 Implants
occurs) it has to be repeated in the same pattern till the
female desires to prevent conception. They inhibit ovulation
and implantation as well as alter the quality of cervical mucus to prevent/
retard entry of sperms. Pills are very effective with lesser side effects and
are well accepted by the females. Saheli –the new oral contraceptive for
the females contains a non-steroidal preparation. It is a ‘once a week’ pill
with very few side effects and high contraceptive value.
Progestogens alone or in combination with estrogen can also be used
by females as injections or implants under the skin (Figure 4.3). Their
mode of action is similar to that of pills and their effective periods are
much longer. Administration of progestogens or progestogen-estrogen
combinations or IUDs within 72 hours of coitus have been found to be
very effective as emergency contraceptives as they could be used to avoid
possible pregnancy due to rape or casual unprotected intercourse.
Surgical methods, also called sterilisation, are generally advised for
the male/female partner as a terminal method to prevent any more
pregnancies. Surgical intervention blocks gamete transport and thereby
prevent conception. Sterilisation procedure in the male is called ‘vasectomy’
61
Figure 4.4a Vasectomy
Figure 4.4 (b) TubectomyBIOLOGY
and that in the female, ‘tubectomy’. In vasectomy, a small part of the vas
deferens is removed or tied up through a small incision on the scrotum
(Figure 4.4a) whereas in tubectomy, a small part of the fallopian tube is
removed (Figure 4.4b) or tied up through a small incision in the abdomen
or through vagina. These techniques are highly effective but their
reversibility is very poor.
It needs to be emphasised that the selection of a suitable contraceptive
method and its use should always be undertaken in consultation with
qualified medical professionals. One must also remember that
contraceptives are not regular requirements for the maintenance of
reproductive health. In fact, they are practiced against a natural
reproductive event, i.e., conception/pregnancy. One is forced to use these
methods either to prevent pregnancy or to delay or space pregnancy due
to personal reasons. No doubt, the widespread use of these methods have
a significant role in checking uncontrolled growth of population. However,
their possible ill-effects like nausea, abdominal pain, breakthrough
bleeding, irregular menstrual bleeding or even breast cancer, though not
very significant, should not be totally ignored.
4.3 M EDICAL T ERMINATION OF P REGNANCY (MTP)
62
Intentional or voluntary termination of pregnancy before full term is called
medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) or induced abortion. Nearly
45 to 50 million MTPs are performed in a year all over the world which
accounts to 1/5th of the total number of conceived pregnancies in a year.
Obviously, MTP has a significant role in decreasing the population though
it is not meant for that purpose. Whether to accept / legalise MTP or not is
being debated upon in many countries due to emotional, ethical, religious
and social issues involved in it. Government of India legalised MTP in
1971 with some strict conditions to avoid its misuse. Such restrictions
are all the more important to check indiscriminate and illegal female
foeticides which are reported to be high in India.
Why MTP ? Obviously the answer is – to get rid of unwanted
pregnancies either due to casual unprotected intercourse or failure of the
contraceptive used during coitus or rapes. MTPs are also essential in
certain cases where continuation of the pregnancy could be harmful or
even fatal either to the mother or to the foetus or both.
MTPs are considered relatively safe during the first trimester, i.e., upto
12 weeks of pregnancy. Second trimester abortions are much more riskier.
One disturbing trend observed is that a majority of the MTPs are performed
illegally by unqualified quacks which are not only unsafe but could be
fatal too. Another dangerous trend is the misuse of amniocentesis to
determine the sex of the unborn child. Frequently, if the foetus is found
to be female, it is followed by MTP- this is totally against what is legal.
Such practices should be avoided because these are dangerous both for
the young mother and the foetus. Effective counselling on the need toREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
avoid unprotected coitus and the risk factors involved in illegal abortions
as well as providing more health care facilities could reverse the mentioned
unhealthy trend.
4.4 S EXUALLY T RANSMITTED D ISEASES (STD S )
Diseases or infections which are transmitted through sexual intercourse
are collectively called sexually transmitted diseases (STD) or venereal
diseases (VD) or reproductive tract infections (RTI). Gonorrhoea, syphilis,
genital herpes, chlamydiasis, genital warts, trichomoniasis, hepatitis-B
and of course, the most discussed infection in the recent years, HIV leading
to AIDS are some of the common STDs. Among these, HIV infection is
most dangerous and is discussed in detail in Chapter 8.
Some of these infections like hepatitis–B and HIV can also be
transmitted by sharing of injection needles, surgical instruments, etc.,
with infected persons, transfusion of blood, or from an infected mother to
the foetus too. Except for hepatitis-B, genital herpes and HIV infections,
other diseases are completely curable if detected early and treated
properly. Early symptoms of most of these are minor and include itching,
fluid discharge, slight pain, swellings, etc., in the genital region. Infected
females may often be asymptomatic and hence, may remain undetected
for long. Absence or less significant symptoms in the early stages of
infection and the social stigma attached to the STDs, deter the infected
persons from going for timely detection and proper treatment. This could
lead to complications later, which include pelvic inflammatory diseases
(PID), abortions, still births, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or even cancer
of the reproductive tract. STDs are a major threat to a healthy society.
Therefore, prevention or early detection and cure of these diseases are
given prime consideration under the reproductive health-care
programmes. Though all persons are vulnerable to these infections, their
incidences are reported to be very high among persons in the age group
of 15-24 years – the age group to which you also belong. There is no
reason to panic because prevention is possible. One could be free of these
infections by following the simple principles given below:
(i) Avoid sex with unknown partners/multiple partners.
(ii) Always use condoms during coitus.
(iii) In case of doubt, one should go to a qualified doctor for early
detection and get complete treatment if diagnosed with disease.
4.5 I NFERTILITY
A discussion on reproductive health is incomplete without a mention of
infertility. A large number of couples all over the world including India
are infertile, i.e., they are unable to produce children inspite of unprotected
sexual co-habitation. The reasons for this could be many–physical,
congenital, diseases, drugs, immunological or even psychological.
63BIOLOGY
64
In India, often the female is blamed for the couple being childless, but
more often than not, the problem lies in the male partner. Specialised
health care units (infertility clinics, etc.) could help in diagnosis and
corrective treatment of some of these disorders and enable these couples to
have children. However, where such corrections are not possible, the couples
could be assisted to have children through certain special techniques
commonly known as assisted reproductive technologies (ART).
In vitro fertilisation (IVF–fertilisation outside the body in almost
similar conditions as that in the body) followed by embryo transfer (ET)
is one of such methods. In this method, popularly known as test tube
baby programme, ova from the wife/donor (female) and sperms from the
husband/donor (male) are collected and are induced to form zygote under
simulated conditions in the laboratory. The zygote or early embryos (with
upto 8 blastomeres) could then be transferred into the fallopian tube
(ZIFT–zygote intra fallopian transfer) and embryos with more than
8 blastomeres, into the uterus (IUT – intra uterine transfer), to complete
its further development. Embryos formed by in-vivo fertilisation (fusion
of gametes within the female) also could be used for such transfer to assist
those females who cannot conceive.
Transfer of an ovum collected from a donor into the fallopian tube
(GIFT – gamete intra fallopian transfer) of another female who cannot
produce one, but can provide suitable environment for fertilisation and
further development is another method attempted. Intra cytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI) is another specialised procedure to form an embryo
in the laboratory in which a sperm is directly injected into the ovum.
Infertility cases either due to inability of the male partner to inseminate
the female or due to very low sperm counts in the ejaculates, could be
corrected by artificial insemination (AI) technique. In this technique,
the semen collected either from the husband or a healthy donor is artificially
introduced either into the vagina or into the uterus (IUI – intra-uterine
insemination) of the female.
Though options are many, all these techniques require extremely
high precision handling by specialised professionals and expensive
instrumentation. Therefore, these facilities are presently available only
in very few centres in the country. Obviously their benefits is affordable
to only a limited number of people. Emotional, religious and social
factors are also deterrents in the adoption of these methods. Since the
ultimate aim of all these procedures is to have children, in India we have
so many orphaned and destitute children, who would probably not
survive till maturity, unless taken care of. Our laws permit legal adoption
and it is as yet, one of the best methods for couples looking for
parenthood.REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
SUMMARY
Reproductive health refers to a total well-being in all aspects of
reproduction, i.e., physical, emotional, behavioural and social. Our
nation was the first nation in the world to initiate various action plans
at national level towards attaining a reproductively healthy society.
Counselling and creating awareness among people about
reproductive organs, adolescence and associated changes, safe and
hygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)
including AIDS, etc., is the primary step towards reproductive health.
Providing medical facilities and care to the problems like menstrual
irregularities, pregnancy related aspects, delivery, medical termination
of pregnancy, STDs, birth control, infertility, post natal child and
maternal management is another important aspect of the Reproductive
and Child Health Care programmes.
An overall improvement in reproductive health has taken place in
our country as indicated by reduced maternal and infant mortality
rates, early detection and cure of STDs, assistance to infertile couples,
etc. Improved health facilities and better living conditions promoted an
explosive growth of population. Such a growth necessitated intense
propagation of contraceptive methods. Various contraceptive options
are available now such as natural, traditional, barrier, IUDs, pills,
injectables, implants and surgical methods. Though contraceptives are
not regular requirements for reproductive health, one is forced to use
them to avoid pregnancy or to delay or space pregnancy.
Medical termination of pregnancy is legalised in our country. MTP is
generally performed to get rid of unwanted pregnancy due to rapes, casual
relationship, etc., as also in cases when the continuation of pregnancy
could be harmful or even fatal to either the mother, or the foetus or both.
Diseases or infections transmitted through sexual intercourse are
called Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs). Pelvic Inflammatory
Diseases (PIDs), still birth, infertility are some of the complications of
them. Early detection facilitate better cure of these diseases. Avoiding
sexual intercourse with unknown/multiple partners, use of condoms
during coitus are some of the simple precautions to avoid contracting
STDs.
Inability to conceive or produce children even after 2 years of
unprotected sexual cohabitation is called infertility. Various methods
are now available to help such couples. In Vitro fertilisation followed by
transfer of embryo into the female genital tract is one such method and
is commonly known as the ‘Test Tube Baby’ Programme.

Evolution
The work of Mendel and others who followed him gave us an
idea of inheritance patterns. However the nature of those ‘factors’
which determine the phenotype was not very clear. As these
‘factors’ represent the genetic basis of inheritance, understanding
the structure of genetic material and the structural basis of
genotype and phenotype conversion became the focus of
attention in biology for the next century. The entire body of
molecular biology was a consequent development with major
contributions from Watson, Crick, Nirenberg, Khorana, Kornbergs
(father and son), Benzer, Monod, Brenner, etc. A parallel problem
being tackled was the mechanism of evolution. Awareness in the
areas of molecular genetics, structural biology and bio informatics
have enriched our understanding of the molecular basis of
evolution. In this unit the structure and function of DNA and the
story and theory of evolution have been examined and explained.
2017-18James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on 6 April 1928. In 1947, he
received B.Sc. degree in Zoology. During these years his interest in
bird-watching had matured into a serious desire to learn genetics. This
became possible when he received a Fellowship for graduate study in
Zoology at Indiana University, Bloomington, where he received his Ph.D.
degree in 1950 on a study of the effect of hard X-rays on bacteriophage
multiplication.
He met Crick and discovered their common interest in solving the
DNA structure. Their first serious effort, was unsatisfactory. Their second effort
based upon more experimental evidence and better appreciation of
the nucleic acid literature, resulted, early in March 1953, in the proposal
of the complementary double-helical configuration.

Have you ever wondered why an elephant always gives
birth only to a baby elephant and not some other animal?
Or why a mango seed forms only a mango plant and not
any other plant?
Given that they do, are the offspring identical to their
parents? Or do they show differences in some of their
characteristics? Have you ever wondered why siblings
sometimes look so similar to each other? Or sometimes
even so different?
These and several related questions are dealt with,
scientifically, in a branch of biology known as Genetics.
This subject deals with the inheritance, as well as the
variation of characters from parents to offspring.
Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed
on from parent to progeny; it is the basis of heredity.
Variation is the degree by which progeny differ from their
parents.
Humans knew from as early as 8000-1000 B.C. that
one of the causes of variation was hidden in sexual
reproduction. They exploited the variations that were
naturally present in the wild populations of plants and
animals to selectively breed and select for organisms that
possessed desirable characters. For example, through
artificial selection and domestication from ancestral
2017-18BIOLOGY
wild cows, we have well-known Indian
breeds, e.g., Sahiwal cows in Punjab. We
must, however, recognise that though our
ancestors knew about the inheritance of
characters and variation, they had very
little idea about the scientific basis of these
phenomena.
5.1 M ENDEL ’ S L AWS
OF
I NHERITANCE
It was during the mid-nineteenth century that
headway was made in the understanding of
inheritance. Gregor Mendel, conducted
hybridisation experiments on garden peas for
seven years (1856-1863) and proposed the
laws of inheritance in living organisms. During
Mendel’s investigations into inheritance
patterns it was for the first time that statistical
analysis and mathematical logic were applied
to problems in biology. His experiments had a
large sampling size, which gave greater
credibility to the data that he collected. Also,
the confirmation of his inferences from
experiments on successive generations of his
test plants, proved that his results pointed to
general rules of inheritance rather than being
unsubstantiated ideas. Mendel investigated
characters in the garden pea plant that were
manifested as two opposing traits, e.g., tall or
dwarf plants, yellow or green seeds. This
allowed him to set up a basic framework of
rules governing inheritance, which was
expanded on by later scientists to account for
all the diverse natural observations and the
complexity inherent in them.
Mendel conducted such artificial
pollination/cross
pollination experiments
Figure 5.1 Seven pairs of contrasting traits in
using several true-breeding pea lines. A true-
pea plant studied by Mendel
breeding line is one that, having undergone
70
continuous self-pollination, shows the stable trait inheritance and
expression for several generations. Mendel selected 14 true-breeding pea
plant varieties, as pairs which were similar except for one character with
contrasting traits. Some of the contrasting traits selected were smooth or
wrinkled seeds, yellow or green seeds, inflated (full) or constricted green
or yellow pods and tall or dwarf plants (Figure 5.1, Table 5.1).

Let us take the example of one such
hybridisation experiment carried out by
Mendel where he crossed tall and dwarf pea
plants to study the inheritance of one gene
(Figure 5.2). He collected the seeds produced
as a result of this cross and grew them to
generate plants of the first hybrid generation.
This generation is also called the Filial 1
progeny or the F 1 . Mendel observed that all
the F 1 progeny plants were tall, like one of
its parents; none were dwarf (Figure 5.3). He
made similar observations for the other pairs
of traits – he found that the F 1 always
resembled either one of the parents, and that
the trait of the other parent was not seen in
them.
Mendel then self-pollinated the tall F 1
plants and to his surprise found that in the
Filial 2 generation some of the offspring were
‘dwarf ’; the character that was not seen in
Figure 5.2 Steps in making a cross in pea
the F 1 generation was now expressed. The
proportion of plants that were dwarf were
1/4 th of the F 2 plants while 3/4 th of the F 2 plants were tall. The tall and
dwarf traits were identical to their parental type and did not show any
blending, that is all the offspring were either tall or dwarf, none were of in-
71
between height (Figure 5.3).
Similar results were obtained with the other traits that he studied:
only one of the parental traits was expressed in the F 1 generation while at
the F 2 stage both the traits were expressed in the proportion 3:1. The
contrasting traits did not show any blending at either F 1 or F 2 stage.
2017-18BIOLOGY
72
Based on these observations,
Mendel proposed that something
was being stably passed down,
unchanged, from parent to offspring
through the gametes, over
successive generations. He called
these things as ‘factors’. Now we call
them as genes. Genes, therefore, are
the units of inheritance. They
contain the information that is
required to express a particular trait
in an organism. Genes which code
for a pair of contrasting traits are
known as alleles, i.e., they are
slightly different forms of the same
gene.
If we use alphabetical symbols
for each gene, then the capital letter
is used for the trait expressed at the
F 1 stage and the small alphabet for
the other trait. For example, in case
of the character of height, T is used
for the Tall trait and t for the ‘dwarf’,
and T and t are alleles of each other.
Hence, in plants the pair of alleles
for height would be TT, Tt or tt.
Mendel also proposed that in a true
Figure 5.3 Diagrammatic representation
breeding, tall or dwarf pea variety
of monohybrid cross
the allelic pair of genes for height are
identical or homozygous, TT and tt, respectively. TT and tt are called
the genotype of the plant while the descriptive terms tall and dwarf are
the phenotype. What then would be the phenotype of a plant that had a
genotype Tt?
As Mendel found the phenotype of the F 1 heterozygote Tt to be exactly
like the TT parent in appearance, he proposed that in a pair of dissimilar
factors, one dominates the other (as in the F 1 ) and hence is called the
dominant factor while the other factor is recessive . In this case T (for
tallness) is dominant over t (for dwarfness), that is recessive. He observed
identical behaviour for all the other characters/trait-pairs that he studied.
It is convenient (and logical) to use the capital and lower case of an
alphabetical symbol to remember this concept of dominance and
recessiveness. (Do not use T for tall and d for dwarf because you will
find it difficult to remember whether T and d are alleles of the same
gene/character or not). Alleles can be similar as in the case of homozygotes
TT and tt or can be dissimilar as in the case of the heterozygote Tt. Since
2017-18PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION
the Tt plant is heterozygous for genes controlling
one character (height), it is a monohybrid and the
cross between TT and tt is a monohybrid cross.
From the observation that the recessive parental
trait is expressed without any blending in the F 2
generation, we can infer that, when the tall and
dwarf plant produce gametes, by the process of
meiosis, the alleles of the parental pair separate or
segregate from each other and only one allele is
transmitted to a gamete. This segregation of alleles
is a random process and so there is a 50 per cent
chance of a gamete containing either allele, as has
been verified by the results of the crossings. In this
way the gametes of the tall TT plants have the allele
T and the gametes of the dwarf tt plants have the
allele t. During fertilisation the two alleles, T from
one parent say, through the pollen, and t from the
other parent, then through the egg, are united to
produce zygotes that have one T allele and one t
allele. In other words the hybrids have Tt. Since
these hybrids contain alleles which express
contrasting traits, the plants are heterozygous. The
production of gametes by the parents, the formation
of the zygotes, the F 1 and F 2 plants can be
understood from a diagram called Punnett Square
as shown in Figure 5.4. It was developed by a British
geneticist, Reginald C. Punnett. It is a graphical
representation to calculate the probability of all
possible genotypes of offspring in a genetic cross.
The possible gametes are written on two sides,
usually the top row and left columns. All possible
combinations are represented in boxes below in the
squares, which generates a square output form.

the genotype Tt when self-pollinated, produces gametes of the genotype
T and t in equal proportion. When fertilisation takes place, the pollen
grains of genotype T have a 50 per cent chance to pollinate eggs of the
genotype T, as well as of genotype t. Also pollen grains of genotype t have
a 50 per cent chance of pollinating eggs of genotype T, as well as of
2017-18BIOLOGY
genotype t. As a result of random fertilisation, the resultant zygotes can
be of the genotypes TT, Tt or tt.
From the Punnett square it is easily seen that 1/4 th of the random
fertilisations lead to TT, 1/2 lead to Tt and 1/4 th to tt. Though the F 1
have a genotype of Tt, but the phenotypic character seen is ‘tall’. At F 2 ,
3/4 th of the plants are tall, where some of them are TT while others are
Tt. Externally it is not possible to distinguish between the plants with
the genotypes TT and Tt. Hence, within the genopytic pair Tt only one
character ‘T ’ tall is expressed. Hence the character T or ‘tall’ is said to
dominate over the other allele t or ‘dwarf’ character. It is thus due to this
dominance of one character over the other that all the F 1 are tall (though
the genotype is Tt) and in the F 2 3/4 th of the plants are tall (though
genotypically 1/2 are Tt and only 1/4 th are TT). This leads to a phenotypic
ratio of 3/4 th tall : (1/4 TT + 1/2 Tt) and 1/4 th tt, i.e., a 3:1 ratio, but a
genotypic ratio of 1:2:1.
The 1/4 : 1/2 : 1/4 ratio of TT: Tt: tt is mathematically condensable
to the form of the binomial expression (ax +by) 2 , that has the gametes
bearing genes T or t in equal frequency of 1⁄2. The expression is expanded
as given below :
(1/2T + 1/2 t) 2 = (1/2T + 1/2t) X (1/2T + 1/2t) = 1/4 TT + 1/2Tt + 1/4 tt
74
Mendel self-pollinated the F 2 plants and found that dwarf F 2 plants
continued to generate dwarf plants in F 3 and F 4 generations. He concluded
that the genotype of the dwarfs was homozygous – tt. What do you think
he would have got had he self-pollinated a tall F 2 plant?
From the preceeding paragraphs it is clear that though the genotypic
ratios can be calculated using mathematical probability, by simply looking
at the phenotype of a dominant trait, it is not possible to know the
genotypic composition. That is, for example, whether a tall plant from F 1
or F 2 has TT or Tt composition, cannot be predicted. Therefore, to determine
the genotype of a tall plant at F 2 , Mendel crossed the tall plant from F 2
with a dwarf plant. This he called a test cross. In a typical test cross an
organism (pea plants here) showing a dominant phenotype (and whose
genotype is to be determined) is crossed with the recessive parent instead
of self-crossing. The progenies of such a cross can easily be analysed to
predict the genotype of the test organism. Figure 5.5 shows the results of
typical test cross where violet colour flower (W) is dominant over white
colour flower (w).
Using Punnett square, try to find out the nature of offspring of a test cross.
What ratio did you get?
Using the genotypes of this cross, can you give a general definition for
a test cross?

Figure 5.5 Diagrammatic representation of a test cross
Based on his observations on monohybrid crosses Mendel proposed
two general rules to consolidate his understanding of inheritance in
monohybrid crosses. Today these rules are called the Principles or
Laws of Inheritance: the First Law or Law of Dominance and the
Second Law or Law of Segregation.
5.2.1 Law of Dominance
(i) Characters are controlled by discrete units called factors.
(ii) Factors occur in pairs.
(iii) In a dissimilar pair of factors one member of the pair dominates
(dominant) the other (recessive).
The law of dominance is used to explain the expression of only one of
the parental characters in a monohybrid cross in the F 1 and the expression
of both in the F 2 . It also explains the proportion of 3:1 obtained at the F 2 .
5.2.2 Law of Segregation
This law is based on the fact that the alleles do not show any blending
and that both the characters are recovered as such in the F 2 generation
though one of these is not seen at the F 1 stage. Though the parents contain
two alleles during gamete formation, the factors or alleles of a pair segregate
from each other such that a gamete receives only one of the two factors.
Of course, a homozygous parent produces all gametes that are similar
while a heterozygous one produces two kinds of gametes each having
one allele with equal proportion.
75
2017-18BIOLOGY
5.2.2.1 Incomplete Dominance
When experiments on peas were repeated using other
traits in other plants, it was found that sometimes
the F 1 had a phenotype that did not resemble either
of the two parents and was in between the two. The
inheritance of flower colour in the dog flower
(snapdragon or Antirrhinum sp.) is a good example
to understand incomplete dominance. In a cross
between true-breeding red-flowered (RR) and true-
breeding white-flowered plants (rr), the F 1 (Rr) was
pink (Figure 5.6). When the F 1 was self-pollinated
the F 2 resulted in the following ratio 1 (RR) Red : 2
(Rr) Pink : 1 (rr) White. Here the genotype ratios were
exactly as we would expect in any mendelian
monohybrid cross, but the phenotype ratios had
changed from the 3:1 dominant : recessive ratio.
What happened was that R was not completely
dominant over r and this made it possible to
distinguish Rr as pink from RR (red) and rr (white) .
Explanation of the concept of dominance:
What exactly is dominance? Why are some alleles
dominant and some recessive? To tackle these
questions, we must understand what a gene does.
Every gene, as you know by now, contains the
information to express a particular trait. In a
diploid organism, there are two copies of each
gene, i.e., as a pair of alleles. Now, these two alleles
need not always be identical, as in a heterozygote.
One of them may be different due to some changes
that it has undergone (about which you will read
further on, and in the next chapter) which modifies
the information that particular allele contains.
Let’s take an example of a gene that contains
the information for producing an enzyme. Now
Figure 5.6 Results of monohybrid cross in
there are two copies of this gene, the two allelic
the plant Snapdragon, where
forms. Let us assume (as is more common) that
one allele is incompletely
dominant over the other allele
the normal allele produces the normal enzyme
that is needed for the transformation of a
76
substrate S. Theoretically, the modified allele could be responsible for
production of –
(i) the normal/less efficient enzyme, or
(ii) a non-functional enzyme, or
(iii) no enzyme at all
2017-18PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION
In the first case, the modified allele is equivalent to the unmodified allele,
i.e., it will produce the same phenotype/trait, i.e., result in the transformation
of substrate S. Such equivalent allele pairs are very common. But, if the
allele produces a non-functional enzyme or no enzyme, the phenotype may
be effected. The phenotype/trait will only be dependent on the functioning
of the unmodified allele. The unmodified (functioning) allele, which represents
the original phenotype is the dominant allele and the modified allele is
generally the recessive allele. Hence, in the example above the recessive trait
is seen due to non-functional enzyme or because no enzyme is produced.
5.2.2.2 Co-dominance
Till now we were discussing crosses where the F 1 resembled either of the
two parents (dominance) or was in-between (incomplete dominance). But,
in the case of co-dominance the F 1 generation resembles both parents. A
good example is different types of red blood cells that determine ABO
blood grouping in human beings. ABO blood groups are controlled by
the gene I. The plasma membrane of the red blood cells has sugar polymers
that protrude from its surface and the kind of sugar is controlled by the
gene. The gene (I) has three alleles I A , I B and i. The alleles I A and I B produce
a slightly different form of the sugar while allele i does not produce any
sugar. Because humans are diploid organisms, each person possesses
any two of the three I gene alleles. I A and I B are completely dominant over
i, in other words when I A and i are present only I A expresses (because i
does not produce any sugar), and when I B and i are present I B expresses.
But when I A and I B are present together they both express their own types
of sugars: this is because of co-dominance. Hence red blood cells have
both A and B types of sugars. Since there are three different alleles, there
are six different combinations of these three alleles that are possible, and
therefore, a total of six different genotypes of the human ABO blood types
(Table 5.2). How many phenotypes are possible?

2017-18BIOLOGY
Do you realise that the example of ABO blood grouping also provides
a good example of multiple alleles? Here you can see that there are
more than two, i.e., three alleles, governing the same character. Since in
an individual only two alleles can be present, multiple alleles can be found
only when population studies are made.
Occasionally, a single gene product may produce more than one effect.
For example, starch synthesis in pea seeds is controlled by one gene. It
has two alleles (B and b). Starch is synthesised effectively by BB
homozygotes and therefore, large starch grains are produced. In contrast,
bb homozygotes have lesser efficiency in starch synthesis and produce
smaller starch grains. After maturation of the seeds, BB seeds are round
and the bb seeds are wrinkled. Heterozygotes produce round seeds, and
so B seems to be the dominant allele. But, the starch grains produced are
of intermediate size in Bb seeds. So if starch grain size is considered as
the phenotype, then from this angle, the alleles show incomplete
dominance.
Therefore, dominance is not an autonomous feature of a gene or the
product that it has information for. It depends as much on the gene
product and the production of a particular phenotype from this product
as it does on the particular phenotype that we choose to examine, in case
more than one phenotype is influenced by the same gene.

Mendel also worked with and crossed pea plants that differed in two
characters, as is seen in the cross between a pea plant that has seeds with
yellow colour and round shape and one that had seeds of green colour
and wrinkled shape (Figure5.7). Mendel found that the seeds resulting
from the crossing of the parents, had yellow coloured and round shaped
seeds. Here can you tell which of the characters in the pairs yellow/
green colour and round/wrinkled shape was dominant?
Thus, yellow colour was dominant over green and round shape
dominant over wrinkled. These results were identical to those that he got
when he made separate monohybrid crosses between yellow and green
seeded plants and between round and wrinkled seeded plants.
Let us use the genotypic symbols Y for dominant yellow seed colour
and y for recessive green seed colour, R for round shaped seeds and r for
wrinkled seed shape. The genotype of the parents can then be written as
RRYY and rryy. The cross between the two plants can be written down
as in Figure 5.7 showing the genotypes of the parent plants. The gametes
RY and ry unite on fertilisation to produce the F 1 hybrid RrYy. When
Mendel self hybridised the F 1 plants he found that 3/4 th of F 2 plants had
yellow seeds and 1/4 th had green. The yellow and green colour segregated
in a 3:1 ratio. Round and wrinkled seed shape also segregated in a 3:1
ratio; just like in a monohybrid cross.

5.3.1 Law of Independent Assortment
In the dihybrid cross (Figure 5.7), the phenotypes round, yellow;
wrinkled, yellow; round, green and wrinkled, green appeared in the
ratio 9:3:3:1. Such a ratio was observed for several pairs of characters
that Mendel studied.
The ratio of 9:3:3:1 can be derived as a combination series of 3 yellow:
1 green, with 3 round : 1 wrinkled. This derivation can be written
as follows:
(3 Round : 1 Wrinkled) (3 Yellow : 1 Green) = 9 Round, Yellow : 3
Wrinkled, Yellow: 3 Round, Green : 1 Wrinkled, Green
Based upon such observations on dihybrid crosses (crosses between
plants differing in two traits) Mendel proposed a second set of generalisations
that we call Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment. The law states that
‘when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair
of characters is independent of the other pair of characters’.
The Punnett square can be effectively used to understand the
independent segregation of the two pairs of genes during meiosis and
the production of eggs and pollen in the F 1 RrYy plant. Consider the
segregation of one pair of genes R and r. Fifty per cent of the gametes
have the gene R and the other 50 per cent have r. Now besides each
gamete having either R or r, it should also have the allele Y or y. The
important thing to remember here is that segregation of 50 per cent R
and 50 per cent r is independent from the segregation of 50 per cent
Y and 50 per cent y. Therefore, 50 per cent of the r bearing gametes
has Y and the other 50 per cent has y. Similarly, 50 per cent of the R
bearing gametes has Y and the other 50 per cent has y. Thus there are
four genotypes of gametes (four types of pollen and four types of eggs).
The four types are RY, Ry, rY and ry each with a frequency of 25 per
cent or 1/4 th of the total gametes produced. When you write down the
four types of eggs and pollen on the two sides of a Punnett square it is
very easy to derive the composition of the zygotes that give rise to the
F 2 plants (Figure 5.7). Although there are 16 squares how many
different types of genotypes and phenotypes are formed? Note them
down in the format given.
Can you, using the Punnett square data work out the genotypic ratio
at the F 2 stage and fill in the format given? Is the genotypic ratio

5.3.2 Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance
Mendel published his work on inheritance of characters in 1865
but for several reasons, it remained unrecognised till 1900. Firstly,
2017-18PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION
communication was not easy (as it is now) in those days and his work
could not be widely publicised. Secondly, his concept of genes (or
factors, in Mendel’s words) as stable and discrete units that controlled
the expression of traits and, of the pair of alleles which did not ‘blend’
with each other, was not accepted by his contemporaries as an
explanation for the apparently continuous variation seen in nature.
Thirdly, Mendel’s approach of using mathematics to explain biological
phenomena was totally new and unacceptable to many of the
biologists of his time. Finally, though Mendel’s work suggested that
factors (genes) were discrete units, he could not provide any physical
proof for the existence of factors or say what they were made of.
In 1900, three Scientists (de Vries, Correns and von Tschermak)
independently rediscovered Mendel’s results on the inheritance of
characters. Also, by this time due to advancements in microscopy that
were taking place, scientists were able to carefully observe cell division.
This led to the discovery of structures in the nucleus that appeared to
double and divide just before each cell division. These were called
chromosomes (colored bodies, as they were visualised by staining). By
1902, the chromosome movement during meiosis had been worked out.
Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri noted that the behaviour of
chromosomes was parallel to the behaviour of genes and used
chromosome movement (Figure 5.8) to explain Mendel’s laws (Table 5.3).
Recall that you have studied the behaviour of chromosomes during mitosis
(equational division) and during meiosis (reduction division). The
important things to remember are that chromosomes as well as genes
occur in pairs. The two alleles of a gene pair are located on homologous
sites on homologous chromosomes.

understand this, compare the chromosomes of four different colour in

2017-18PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION
Sutton and Boveri argued that the pairing and separation of
a pair of chromosomes would lead to the segregation of a pair of
factors they carried. Sutton united the knowledge of chromosomal
segregation with Mendelian principles and called it the
chromosomal theory of inheritance.
Following this synthesis of ideas, experimental verification of
the chromosomal theory of inheritance by Thomas Hunt Morgan
(a)
(b)
and his colleagues, led to discovering the basis for the variation
that sexual reproduction produced. Morgan worked with the tiny Figure 5.10 Drosophila
melanogaster (a) Male
fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 5.10), which were
(b) Female
found very suitable for such studies. They could be grown on
simple synthetic medium in the laboratory. They complete their life
cycle in about two weeks, and a single mating could produce a large
number of progeny flies. Also, there was a clear differentiation of
the sexes – the male and female flies are easily distinguishable. Also,
it has many types of hereditary variations that can be seen with
low power microscopes.
5.3.3 Linkage and Recombination
Morgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in Drosophila to study genes
that were sex-linked. The crosses were similar to the dihybrid crosses carried
out by Mendel in peas. For example Morgan hybridised yellow-bodied,
white-eyed females to brown-bodied, red-eyed males and intercrossed their
F 1 progeny. He observed that the two genes did not segregate independently
of each other and the F 2 ratio deviated very significantly from the 9:3:3:1
ratio (expected when the two genes are independent).
Morgan and his group knew that the genes were located on the X
chromosome (Section 5.4) and saw quickly that when the two genes in a
dihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion
of parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental
type. Morgan attributed this due to the physical association or linkage
of the two genes and coined the term linkage to describe this physical
association of genes on a chromosome and the term recombination to
describe the generation of non-parental gene combinations (Figure 5.11).
Morgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped
on the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked (showed
very low recombination) (Figure 5.11, Cross A) while others were loosely
linked (showed higher recombination) (Figure 5.11, Cross B). For
example he found that the genes white and yellow were very tightly linked
and showed only 1.3 per cent recombination while white and miniature
wing showed 37.2 per cent recombination. His student Alfred
Sturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs
on the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes
and ‘mapped’ their position on the chromosome. Today genetic maps
83

are extensively used as a starting point in the sequencing of whole
genomes as was done in the case of the Human Genome Sequencing
Project, described later.

5.6 S EX D ETERMINATION
(Please see Page 287 and 288 also)
The mechanism of sex determination has
always been a puzzle before the geneticists.
The initial clue about the genetic/
chromosomal mechanism of sex
determination can be traced back to some
of the experiments carried out in insects. In
fact, the cytological observations made in a
number of insects led to the development of
the concept of genetic/chromosomal basis
(a)
of sex-determination. Henking (1891) could
trace a specific nuclear structure all through
spermatogenesis in a few insects, and it was
also observed by him that 50 per cent of the
sperm received this structure after
spermatogenesis, whereas the other 50 per
cent sperm did not receive it. Henking gave
(b)
a name to this structure as the X body but
he could not explain its significance. Further
investigations by other scientists led to the
conclusion that the ‘X body’ of Henking was
in fact a chromosome and that is why it was
given the name X-chromosome. It was also
observed that in a large number of insects the
mechanism of sex determination is of the XO
type, i.e., all eggs bear an additional X-
(c)
chromosome besides the other
chromosomes (autosomes). On the other
hand, some of the sperms bear the Figure 5.12 Determination of sex by chromosomal

think the number of chromosomes in the male

and female are equal? Due to the involvement
of the X-chromosome in the determination of
sex, it was designated to be the sex chromosome, and the rest of the
85
chromosomes were named as autosomes.Grasshopper is an example of XO
type of sex determination in which the males have only one X-chromosome
besides the autosomes, whereas females have a pair of X-chromosomes.
These observations led to the investigation of a number of species to
understand the mechanism of sex determination. In a number of other
insects and mammals including man, XY type of sex determination is
seen where both male and female have same number of chromosomes.
2017-18BIOLOGY
Among the males an X-chromosome is present but its counter part is
distinctly smaller and called the Y-chromosome. Females, however, have
a pair of X-chromosomes. Both males and females bear same number of
autosomes. Hence, the males have autosomes plus XY, while female have
autosomes plus XX. In human beings and in Drosophila the males have
one X and one Y chromosome, whereas females have a pair of X-
chromosomes besides autosomes (Figure 5.12 a, b).
In the above description you have studied about two types of sex
determining mechanisms, i.e., XO type and XY type. But in both cases
males produce two different types of gametes, (a) either with or without
X-chromosome or (b) some gametes with X-chromosome and some with
Y-chromosome. Such types of sex determination mechanism is
designated to be the example of male heterogamety. In some other
organisms, e.g., birds, a different mechanism of sex determination is
observed (Figure 5.12 c). In this case the total number of chromosome
is same in both males and females. But two different types of gametes in
terms of the sex chromosomes, are produced by females, i.e., female
heterogamety. In order to have a distinction with the mechanism of
sex determination described earlier, the two different sex chromosomes
of a female bird has been designated to be the Z and W chromosomes.
In these organisms the females have one Z and one W chromosome,
whereas males have a pair of Z-chromosomes besides the autosomes.
5.6.1 Sex Determination in Humans
86
It has already been mentioned that the sex determining mechanism in
case of humans is XY type. Out of 23 pairs of chromosomes present, 22
pairs are exactly same in both males and females; these are the autosomes.
A pair of X-chromosomes are present in the female, whereas the presence
of an X and Y chromosome are determinant of the male characteristic.
During spermatogenesis among males, two types of gametes are produced.
50 per cent of the total sperm produced carry the X-chromosome and
the rest 50 per cent has Y-chromosome besides the autosomes. Females,
however, produce only one type of ovum with an X-chromosome. There
is an equal probability of fertilisation of the ovum with the sperm carrying
either X or Y chromosome. In case the ovum fertilises with a sperm
carrying X-chromosome the zygote develops into a female (XX) and the
fertilisation of ovum with Y-chromosome carrying sperm results into a
male offspring. Thus, it is evident that it is the genetic makeup of the
sperm that determines the sex of the child. It is also evident that in each
pregnancy there is always 50 per cent probability of either a male or a
female child. It is unfortunate that in our society women are blamed for
giving birth to female children and have been ostracised and ill-treated
because of this false notion.
How is the sex-determination mechanism different in the birds?
Is the sperm or the egg responsible for the sex of the chicks?
2017-18PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION
5.7 M UTATION
Mutation is a phenomenon which results in alteration of DNA sequences
and consequently results in changes in the genotype and the phenotype
of an organism. In addition to recombination, mutation is another
phenomenon that leads to variation in DNA.
As you will learn in Chapter 6, one DNA helix runs continuously from
one end to the other in each chromatid, in a highly supercoiled form.
Therefore loss (deletions) or gain (insertion/duplication) of a segment of
DNA, result in alteration in chromosomes. Since genes are known to be
located on chromosomes, alteration in chromosomes results in
abnormalities or aberrations. Chromosomal aberrations are commonly
observed in cancer cells.
In addition to the above, mutation also arise due to change in a single
base pair of DNA. This is known as point mutation. A classical example of
such a mutation is sickle cell anemia. Deletions and insertions of base
pairs of DNA, causes frame-shift mutations (see Chapter 6).
The mechanism of mutation is beyond the scope of this discussion, at
this level. However, there are many chemical and physical factors that
induce mutations. These are referred to as mutagens. UV radiations can
cause mutations in organisms – it is a mutagen.

5.8.1 Pedigree Analysis
The idea that disorders are inherited has been prevailing in the human
society since long. This was based on the heritability of certain
characteristic features in families. After the rediscovery of Mendel’s work
the practice of analysing inheritance pattern of traits in human beings
began. Since it is evident that control crosses that can be performed in
pea plant or some other organisms, are not possible in case of human
beings, study of the family history about inheritance of a particular trait
provides an alternative. Such an analysis of traits in a several of
generations of a family is called the pedigree analysis. In the pedigree
analysis the inheritance of a particular trait is represented in the family
tree over generations.
In human genetics, pedigree study provides a strong tool, which is
utilised to trace the inheritance of a specific trait, abnormality or disease.
Some of the important standard symbols used in the pedigree analysis
have been shown in Figure 5.13.
As you have studied in this chapter, each and every feature in any
organism is controlled by one or the other gene located on the DNA present
in the chromosome. DNA is the carrier of genetic information. It is hence
transmitted from one generation to the other without any change or
87
2017-18BIOLOGY
alteration. However, changes or alteration do take
place occasionally. Such an alteration or change in
the genetic material is referred to as mutation. A
number of disorders in human beings have been
found to be associated with the inheritance of changed
or altered genes or chromosomes.
5.8.2 Mendelian Disorders
Broadly, genetic disorders may be grouped into two
categories – Mendelian disorders and Chromosomal
disorders. Mendelian disorders are mainly
determined by alteration or mutation in the single
gene. These disorders are transmitted to the
offspring on the same lines as we have studied in
the principle of inheritance. The patter n of
inheritance of such Mendelian disorders can be
traced in a family by the pedigree analysis. Most
common and prevalent Mendelian disorders are
Haemophilia, Cystic fibrosis, Sickle-cell anaemia,
Colour blindness, Phenylketonuria, Thalassemia, etc.
It is important to mention here that such Mendelian
disorders may be dominant or recessive. By pedigree
analysis one can easily understand whether the trait
Figure 5.13 Symbols used in the human
in question is dominant or recessive. Similarly, the
pedigree analysis
trait may also be linked to the sex chromosome as in
case of haemophilia. It is evident that this X-linked
recessive trait shows transmission from carrier female to male progeny. A
representative pedigree is shown in Figure 5.14 for dominant and recessive
traits. Discuss with your teacher and design pedigrees for characters
linked to both autosomes and sex chromosome.

2017-18PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION
Haemophilia : This sex linked recessive disease, which shows its
transmission from unaffected carrier female to some of the male progeny
has been widely studied. In this disease, a single protein that is a part of
the cascade of proteins involved in the clotting of blood is affected. Due to
this, in an affected individual a simple cut will result in non-stop bleeding.
The heterozygous female (carrier) for haemophilia may transmit the disease
to sons. The possibility of a female becoming a haemophilic is extremely
rare because mother of such a female has to be at least carrier and the
father should be haemophilic (unviable in the later stage of life). The family
pedigree of Queen Victoria shows a number of haemophilic descendents
as she was a carrier of the disease. (Please see Page 289 also)
Sickle-cell anaemia : This is an autosome linked recessive trait that can
be transmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners are
carrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The disease is controlled by a single
pair of allele, Hb A and Hb S . Out of the three possible genotypes only
homozygous individuals for Hb S (Hb S Hb S ) show the diseased phenotype.
Heterozygous (Hb A Hb S ) individuals appear apparently unaffected but they
are carrier of the disease as there is 50 per cent probability of transmission
of the mutant gene to the progeny, thus exhibiting sickle-cell trait (Figure
5.15). The defect is caused by the substitution of Glutamic acid (Glu) by
89

2017-18BIOLOGY
Valine (Val) at the sixth position of the beta globin chain of the haemoglobin
molecule. The substitution of amino acid in the globin protein results
due to the single base substitution at the sixth codon of the beta globin
gene from GAG to GUG. The mutant haemoglobin molecule undergoes
polymerisation under low oxygen tension causing the change in the shape
of the RBC from biconcave disc to elongated sickle like structure (Figure
5.15).
Phenylketonuria : This inborn error of metabolism is also inherited as
the autosomal recessive trait. The affected individual lacks an enzyme
that converts the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. As a result of
this phenylalanine is accumulated and converted into phenylpyruvic acid
and other derivatives. Accumulation of these in brain results in mental
retardation. These are also excreted through urine because of its poor
absorption by kidney. (Please see Page 289 also)
5.8.3 Chromosomal Disorders
The chromosomal disorders on the other hand are caused due to absence
or excess or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes.
Failure of segregation of chromatids during cell division cycle results
in the gain or loss of a chromosome(s), called aneuploidy. For example,
Down’s syndrome results in the gain of extra copy of chromosome 21.
Similarly, Turner’s syndrome results due to loss of an X chromosome in
human females. Failure of cytokinesis after telophase stage of cell division
results in an increase in a whole set of chromosomes in an organism and,

this phenomenon is known as polyploidy. This
condition is often seen in plants.
The total number of chromosomes in a
normal human cell is 46 (23 pairs). Out of these
22 pairs are autosomes and one pair of
chromosomes are sex chromosome.
Sometimes, though rarely, either an additional
copy of a chromosome may be included in an
individual or an individual may lack one of any
one pair of chromosomes. These situations are
known as trisomy or monosomy of a
chromosome, respectively. Such a situation
leads to very serious consequences in the
individual. Down’s syndrome, Turner’s
syndrome, Klinefelter’s syndrome are common
examples of chromosomal disorders.
Down’s Syndrome : The cause of this genetic
disorder is the presence of an additional copy
of the chromosome number 21 (trisomy of 21).
This disorder was first described by Langdon
Down (1866). The affected individual is short
statured with small round head, furrowed
tongue and partially open mouth (Figure 5.16).
Palm is broad with characteristic palm crease.

i.e., Gynaecomastia) is also expressed (Figure

Turner’s Syndrome : Such a disorder is
caused due to the absence of one of the X
chromosomes, i.e., 45 with X0, Such females
are sterile as ovaries are rudimentary besides
other features including lack of other secondary
sexual characters (Figure 5.17 b).

SUMMARY
92
Genetics is a branch of biology which deals with principles of inheritance
and its practices. Progeny resembling the parents in morphological and
physiological features has attracted the attention of many biologists.
Mendel was the first to study this phenomenon systematically. While
studying the pattern of inheritance in pea plants of contrasting
characters, Mendel proposed the principles of inheritance, which are
today referred to as ‘Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance’. He proposed that
the ‘factors’ (later named as genes) regulating the characters are found
in pairs known as alleles. He observed that the expression of the
characters in the offspring follow a definite pattern in different–first
generations (F 1 ), second (F 2 ) and so on. Some characters are dominant
over others. The dominant characters are expressed when factors are
in heterozygous condition (Law of Dominance). The recessive characters
are only expressed in homozygous conditions. The characters never
blend in heterozygous condition. A recessive character that was not
expressed in heterozygous conditon may be expressed again when it
becomes homozygous. Hence, characters segregate while formation of
gametes (Law of Segregation).
Not all characters show true dominance. Some characters show
incomplete, and some show co-dominance. When Mendel studied the
inheritance of two characters together, it was found that the factors
independently assort and combine in all permutations and
combinations (Law of Independent Assortment). Different combinations
of gametes are theoretically represented in a square tabular form known
as ‘Punnett Square’. The factors (now known as gene) on chromosomes
regulating the characters are called the genotype and the physical
expression of the chraracters is called phenotype.
After knowing that the genes are located on the chromosomes, a
good correlation was drawn between Mendel’s laws : segregation and
assortment of chromosomes during meiosis. The Mendel’s laws were
extended in the form of ‘Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance’. Later, it
was found that Mendel’s law of independent assortment does not hold
true for the genes that were located on the same chromosomes. These
genes were called as ‘linked genes’. Closely located genes assorted
together, and distantly located genes, due to recombination, assorted
independently. Linkage maps, therefore, corresponded to arrangement
of genes on a chromosome.
Many genes were linked to sexes also, and called as sex-linked
genes. The two sexes (male and female) were found to have a set of
chromosomes which were common, and another set which was
different. The chromosomes which were different in two sexes were
named as sex chromosomes. The remaining set was named as
autosomes. In humans, a normal female has 22 pairs of autosomes
2017-18PRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION
and a pair of sex chromosomes (XX). A male has 22 pairs of autosomes
and a pair of sex chromosome as XY. In chicken, sex chromosomes in
male are ZZ, and in females are ZW.
Mutation is defined as change in the genetic material. A point
mutation is a change of a single base pair in DNA. Sickle-cell anemia is
caused due to change of one base in the gene coding for beta-chain of
hemoglobin. Inheritable mutations can be studied by generating a
pedigree of a family. Some mutations involve changes in whole set of
chromosomes (polyploidy) or change in a subset of chromosome number
(aneuploidy). This helped in understanding the mutational basis of
genetic disorders. Down’s syndrome is due to trisomy of chromosome 21,
where there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 and consequently the
total number of chromosome becomes 47. In Turner’s syndrome, one X
chromosome is missing and the sex chromosome is as XO, and in
Klinefelter’s syndrome, the condition is XXY. These can be easily studied
by analysis of Karyotypes.

In the previous chapter, you have learnt the inheritance
patterns and the genetic basis of such patterns. At the
time of Mendel, the nature of those ‘factors’ regulating
the pattern of inheritance was not clear. Over the next
hundred years, the nature of the putative genetic material
was investigated culminating in the realisation that
DNA – deoxyribonucleic acid – is the genetic material, at
least for the majority of organisms. In class XI you have
learnt that nucleic acids are polymers of nucleotides.
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid
(RNA) are the two types of nucleic acids found in living
systems. DNA acts as the genetic material in most of the
organisms. RNA though it also acts as a genetic material
in some viruses, mostly functions as a messenger. RNA
has additional roles as well. It functions as adapter,
structural, and in some cases as a catalytic molecule. In
Class XI you have already learnt the structures of
nucleotides and the way these monomer units are linked
to form nucleic acid polymers. In this chapter we are going
to discuss the structure of DNA, its replication, the process
of making RNA from DNA (transcription), the genetic code
that determines the sequences of amino acids in proteins,
the process of protein synthesis (translation) and
elementary basis of their regulation. The determination
2017-18BIOLOGY
of complete nucleotide sequence of human genome during last decade
has set in a new era of genomics. In the last section, the essentials of
human genome sequencing and its consequences will also be discussed.
Let us begin our discussion by first understanding the structure of
the most interesting molecule in the living system, that is, the DNA. In
subsequent sections, we will understand that why it is the most abundant
genetic material, and what its relationship is with RNA.
6.1 T HE DNA
DNA is a long polymer of deoxyribonucleotides. The length of DNA is
usually defined as number of nucleotides (or a pair of nucleotide referred
to as base pairs) present in it. This also is the characteristic of an organism.
For example, a bacteriophage known as φ ×174 has 5386 nucleotides,
Bacteriophage lambda has 48502 base pairs (bp), Escherichia coli has
4.6 × 10 6 bp, and haploid content of human DNA is 3.3 × 10 9 bp. Let us
discuss the structure of such a long polymer.
6.1.1 Structure of Polynucleotide Chain
Let us recapitulate the chemical structure of a polynucleotide chain (DNA
or RNA). A nucleotide has three components – a nitrogenous base, a
pentose sugar (ribose in case of RNA, and deoxyribose for DNA), and a
phosphate group. There are two types of nitrogenous bases – Purines
(Adenine and Guanine), and Pyrimidines (Cytosine, Uracil and Thymine).
Cytosine is common for both DNA and RNA and Thymine is present in
DNA. Uracil is present in RNA at the place of Thymine. A nitrogenous
base is linked to the pentose sugar through a N-glycosidic linkage to
form a nucleoside, such as adenosine or deoxyadenosine, guanosine or
deoxyguanosine, cytidine or deoxycytidine and uridine or deoxythymidine.
When a phosphate group is linked to 5 ' -OH of a nucleoside through
phosphoester linkage, a corresponding nucleotide (or deoxynucleotide
depending upon the type of sugar present) is formed. Two nucleotides
are linked through 3 ' -5 ' phosphodiester linkage to form a dinucleotide.
More nucleotides can be joined in such a manner to form a polynucleotide
chain. A polymer thus formed has at one end a free phosphate moiety at
96
Figure 6.1 A Polynucleotide chain
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
5 ' -end of ribose sugar, which is referred to as 5’-end of polynucleotide
chain. Similarly, at the other end of the polymer the ribose has a free
3 ' -OH group which is referred to as 3' - end of the polynucleotide chain.
The backbone in a polynucleotide chain is formed due to sugar and
phosphates. The nitrogenous bases linked to sugar moiety project from
the backbone (Figure 6.1).
In RNA, every nucleotide residue has an additional –OH group present
at 2 ' -position in the ribose. Also, in RNA the uracil is found at the place of
thymine (5-methyl uracil, another chemical name for thymine).
DNA as an acidic substance present in nucleus was first identified by
Friedrich Meischer in 1869. He named it as ‘Nuclein’. However, due to
technical limitation in isolating such a long polymer intact, the elucidation
of structure of DNA remained elusive for a very long period of time. It was
only in 1953 that James Watson and Francis Crick, based on the X-ray
diffraction data produced by Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin,
proposed a very simple but famous Double Helix model for the structure
of DNA. One of the hallmarks of their proposition was base pairing between
the two strands of polynucleotide chains. However, this proposition was
also based on the observation of Erwin Chargaff that for a double stranded
DNA, the ratios between Adenine and Thymine and Guanine and Cytosine
are constant and equals one.
The base pairing confers a very unique property to the polynucleotide
chains. They are said to be complementary to each other, and therefore if
the sequence of bases in one strand is known then the sequence in other
strand can be predicted. Also, if each strand from a DNA (let us call it as a
parental DNA) acts as a template for synthesis of a new strand, the two
double stranded DNA (let us call them as daughter DNA) thus, produced
would be identical to the parental DNA molecule. Because of this, the genetic
implications of the structure of DNA became very clear.
The salient features of the Double-helix structure of DNA are as follows:
(i) It is made of two polynucleotide chains, where the backbone is
constituted by sugar-phosphate, and the bases project inside.
(ii) The two chains have anti-parallel polarity. It means, if one
chain has the polarity 5 ' à3 ' , the other has 3 ' à5 ' .
(iii) The bases in two strands are paired through hydrogen bond
(H-bonds) forming base pairs (bp). Adenine forms two hydrogen
bonds with Thymine from opposite strand and vice-versa.
Similarly, Guanine is bonded with Cytosine with three H-bonds.
As a result, always a purine comes opposite to a pyrimidine. This
generates approximately uniform distance between the two
strands of the helix (Figure 6.2).
(iv) The two chains are coiled in a right-handed fashion. The pitch
of the helix is 3.4 nm (a nanometre is one billionth of a
metre, that is 10 -9 m) and there are roughly 10 bp in each
97
2017-18BIOLOGY
Figure 6.2 Double stranded polynucleotide chain
Figure 6.3 DNA double helix
turn. Consequently, the distance
between a bp in a h e l i x i s
approximately equal to 0.34 nm.
(v) The plane of one base pair stacks
over the other in double helix. This,
in addition to H-bonds, confers
stability of the helical structure
(Figure 6.3).
Compare the structure of purines and
pyrimidines. Can you find out why the
distance between two polynucleotide
chains in DNA remains almost constant?
The proposition of a double helix
structure for DNA and its simplicity in
explaining the genetic implication became
revolutionary. Very soon, Francis Crick
proposed the Central dogma in molecular
biology, which states that the genetic
information flows from DNAàRNAàProtein.
98
Central dogma
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
In some viruses the flow of information is in reverse direction, that is,
from RNA to DNA. Can you suggest a simple name to the process?
6.1.2 Packaging of DNA Helix
Taken the distance between two consecutive base pairs
as 0.34 nm (0.34×10 –9 m), if the length of DNA double
helix in a typical mammalian cell is calculated (simply
by multiplying the total number of bp with distance
between two consecutive bp, that is, 6.6 × 10 9 bp ×
0.34 × 10 -9 m/bp), it comes out to be approximately
2.2 metres. A length that is far greater than the
dimension of a typical nucleus (approximately 10 –6 m).
How is such a long polymer packaged in a cell?
If the length of E. coli DNA is 1.36 mm, can you
calculate the number of base pairs in E.coli?
In prokaryotes, such as, E. coli, though they do
Figure 6.4a Nucleosome
not have a defined nucleus, the DNA is not scattered
throughout the cell. DNA (being negatively charged)
is held with some proteins (that have positive
charges) in a region termed as ‘nucleoid’. The DNA
in nucleoid is organised in large loops held by
proteins.
In eukaryotes, this organisation is much more
complex. There is a set of positively charged, basic
proteins called histones. A protein acquires charge
depending upon the abundance of amino acids
residues with charged side chains. Histones are rich
in the basic amino acid residues lysines and
arginines. Both the amino acid residues carry Figure 6.4b EM picture - ‘Beads-on-String’
positive charges in their side chains. Histones are
organised to form a unit of eight molecules called
as histone octamer. The negatively charged DNA is wrapped around
the positively charged histone octamer to form a structure called
nucleosome (Figure 6.4 a). A typical nucleosome contains 200 bp of
DNA helix. Nucleosomes constitute the repeating unit of a structure in
nucleus called chromatin, thread-like stained (coloured) bodies seen in
nucleus. The nucleosomes in chromatin are seen as ‘beads-on-string’
structure when viewed under electron microscope (EM) (Figure 6.4 b).
99
Theoretically, how many such beads (nucleosomes) do you imagine
are present in a mammalian cell?
The beads-on-string structure in chromatin is packaged to form
chromatin fibers that are further coiled and condensed at metaphase stage
of cell division to form chromosomes. The packaging of chromatin at higher
level requires additional set of proteins that collectively are referred to as
2017-18BIOLOGY
Non-histone Chromosomal (NHC) proteins. In a typical nucleus, some
region of chromatin are loosely packed (and stains light) and are referred to
as euchromatin. The chromatin that is more densely packed and stains
dark are called as Heterochromatin. Euchromatin is said to be
transcriptionally active chromatin, whereas heterochromatin is inactive.
6.2 T HE S EARCH
FOR
G ENETIC M ATERIAL
Even though the discovery of nuclein by Meischer and the proposition
for principles of inheritance by Mendel were almost at the same time, but
that the DNA acts as a genetic material took long to be discovered and
proven. By 1926, the quest to determine the mechanism for genetic
inheritance had reached the molecular level. Previous discoveries by
Gregor Mendel, Walter Sutton, Thomas Hunt Morgan and numerous other
scientists had narrowed the search to the chromosomes located in the
nucleus of most cells. But the question of what molecule was actually the
genetic material, had not been answered.
Transforming Principle
In 1928, Frederick Griffith, in a series of experiments with Streptococcus
pneumoniae (bacterium responsible for pneumonia), witnessed a
miraculous transformation in the bacteria. During the course of his
experiment, a living organism (bacteria) had changed in physical form.
When Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) bacteria are grown
on a culture plate, some produce smooth shiny colonies (S) while others
produce rough colonies (R). This is because the S strain bacteria have a
mucous (polysaccharide) coat, while R strain does not. Mice infected with
the S strain (virulent) die from pneumonia infection but mice infected
with the R strain do not develop pneumonia.
Griffith was able to kill bacteria by heating them. He observed that
heat-killed S strain bacteria injected into mice did not kill them. When he
100
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
injected a mixture of heat-killed S and live R bacteria, the mice died.
Moreover, he recovered living S bacteria from the dead mice.
He concluded that the R strain bacteria had somehow been
transformed by the heat-killed S strain bacteria. Some ‘transforming
principle’, transferred from the heat-killed S strain, had enabled the
R strain to synthesise a smooth polysaccharide coat and become virulent.
This must be due to the transfer of the genetic material. However, the
biochemical nature of genetic material was not defined from his
experiments.
Biochemical Characterisation of Transforming Principle
Prior to the work of Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty
(1933-44), the genetic material was thought to be a protein. They worked
to determine the biochemical nature of ‘transforming principle’ in Griffith's
experiment.
They purified biochemicals (proteins, DNA, RNA, etc.) from the
heat-killed S cells to see which ones could transform live R cells into
S cells. They discovered that DNA alone from S bacteria caused R bacteria
to become transformed.
They also discovered that protein-digesting enzymes (proteases) and
RNA-digesting enzymes (RNases) did not affect transformation, so the
transforming substance was not a protein or RNA. Digestion with DNase
did inhibit transformation, suggesting that the DNA caused the
transformation. They concluded that DNA is the hereditary material, but
not all biologists were convinced.
Can you think of any difference between DNAs and DNase?
6.2.1 The Genetic Material is DNA
The unequivocal proof that DNA is the genetic material came from the
experiments of Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase (1952). They worked
with viruses that infect bacteria called bacteriophages.
The bacteriophage attaches to the bacteria and its genetic material
then enters the bacterial cell. The bacterial cell treats the viral genetic
material as if it was its own and subsequently manufactures more virus
particles. Hershey and Chase worked to discover whether it was protein
or DNA from the viruses that entered the bacteria.
They grew some viruses on a medium that contained radioactive
phosphorus and some others on medium that contained radioactive sulfur.
Viruses grown in the presence of radioactive phosphorus contained
radioactive DNA but not radioactive protein because DNA contains
phosphorus but protein does not. Similarly, viruses grown on radioactive
sulfur contained radioactive protein but not radioactive DNA because
DNA does not contain sulfur.
101
2017-18BIOLOGY
Radioactive phages were allowed to attach to E. coli bacteria. Then, as
the infection proceeded, the viral coats were removed from the bacteria by
agitating them in a blender. The virus particles were separated from the
bacteria by spinning them in a centrifuge.
Bacteria which was infected with viruses that had radioactive DNA
were radioactive, indicating that DNA was the material that passed from
the virus to the bacteria. Bacteria that were infected with viruses that had
radioactive proteins were not radioactive. This indicates that proteins did
not enter the bacteria from the viruses. DNA is therefore the genetic
material that is passed from virus to bacteria (Figure 6.5).
Figure 6.5 The Hershey-Chase experiment
102
6.2.2 Properties of Genetic Material (DNA versus RNA)
From the foregoing discussion, it is clear that the debate between proteins
versus DNA as the genetic material was unequivocally resolved from
Hershey-Chase experiment. It became an established fact that it is DNA
that acts as genetic material. However, it subsequently became clear that
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
in some viruses, RNA is the genetic material (for example, Tobacco Mosaic
viruses, QB bacteriophage, etc.). Answer to some of the questions such as,
why DNA is the predominant genetic material, whereas RNA performs
dynamic functions of messenger and adapter has to be found from the
differences between chemical structures of the two nucleic acid molecules.
Can you recall the two chemical differences between DNA and RNA?
A molecule that can act as a genetic material must fulfill the following
criteria:
(i) It should be able to generate its replica (Replication).
(ii) It should chemically and structurally be stable.
(iii) It should provide the scope for slow changes (mutation) that
are required for evolution.
(iv) It should be able to express itself in the form of 'Mendelian
Characters’.
If one examines each requirement one by one, because of rule of base
pairing and complementarity, both the nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) have
the ability to direct their duplications. The other molecules in the living
system, such as proteins fail to fulfill first criteria itself.
The genetic material should be stable enough not to change with
different stages of life cycle, age or with change in physiology of the
organism. Stability as one of the properties of genetic material was very
evident in Griffith’s ‘transforming principle’ itself that heat, which killed
the bacteria, at least did not destroy some of the properties of genetic
material. This now can easily be explained in light of the DNA that the
two strands being complementary if separated by heating come together,
when appropriate conditions are provided. Further, 2 ' -OH group present
at every nucleotide in RNA is a reactive group and makes RNA labile and
easily degradable. RNA is also now known to be catalytic, hence reactive.
Therefore, DNA chemically is less reactive and structurally more stable
when compared to RNA. Therefore, among the two nucleic acids, the DNA
is a better genetic material.
In fact, the presence of thymine at the place of uracil also confers
additional stability to DNA. (Detailed discussion about this requires
understanding of the process of repair in DNA, and you will study these
processes in higher classes.)
Both DNA and RNA are able to mutate. In fact, RNA being unstable,
mutate at a faster rate. Consequently, viruses having RNA genome and
having shorter life span mutate and evolve faster.
RNA can directly code for the synthesis of proteins, hence can easily
express the characters. DNA, however, is dependent on RNA for synthesis
of proteins. The protein synthesising machinery has evolved around RNA.
The above discussion indicate that both RNA and DNA can function as
103
2017-18BIOLOGY
genetic material, but DNA being more stable is preferred for storage of
genetic information. For the transmission of genetic information, RNA
is better.

From foregoing discussion, an immediate question becomes evident –
which is the first genetic material? It shall be discussed in detail in the
chapter on chemical evolution, but briefly, we shall highlight some of the
facts and points.
RNA was the first genetic material. There is now enough evidence to
suggest that essential life processes (such as metabolism, translation,
splicing, etc.), evolved around RNA. RNA used to act as
a genetic material as well as a catalyst (there are some
important biochemical reactions in living systems that
are catalysed by RNA catalysts and not by protein
enzymes). But, RNA being a catalyst was reactive and
hence unstable. Therefore, DNA has evolved from RNA
with chemical modifications that make it more stable.
DNA being double stranded and having complementary
strand further resists changes by evolving a process of
repair.
6.4 R EPLICATION
While proposing the double helical structure for DNA,
Watson and Crick had immediately proposed a scheme
for replication of DNA. To quote their original statement
that is as follows:
‘‘It has not escaped our notice that the specific
pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a
possible copying mechanism for the genetic material’’
(Watson and Crick, 1953).
The scheme suggested that the two strands would
separate and act as a template for the synthesis of new
Figure 6.6 Watson-Crick model for complementary strands. After the completion of
se m i c o n s e r v a t i v e D N A replication, each DNA molecule would have one
replication
parental and one newly synthesised strand. This
scheme was termed as semiconservative DNA
104
replication (Figure 6.6).
6.4.1 The Experimental Proof
It is now proven that DNA replicates semiconservatively. It was shown first in
Escherichia coli and subsequently in higher organisms, such as plants
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
and human cells. Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl performed the
following experiment in 1958:
(i) They grew E. coli in a medium containing 15 NH 4 Cl ( 15 N is the heavy
isotope of nitrogen) as the only nitrogen source for many
generations. The result was that 15 N was incorporated into newly
synthesised DNA (as well as other nitrogen containing compounds).
This heavy DNA molecule could be distinguished from the normal
DNA by centrifugation in a cesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient
(Please note that 15 N is not a radioactive isotope, and it can be
separated from 14 N only based on densities).
(ii) Then they transferred the cells into a medium with normal
14
NH 4 Cl and took samples at various definite time intervals as
the cells multiplied, and extracted the DNA that remained as
double-stranded helices. The various samples were separated
independently on CsCl gradients to measure the densities of
DNA (Figure 6.7).
Can you recall what centrifugal force is, and think why a
molecule with higher mass/density would sediment faster?
The results are shown in Figure 6.7.
Figure 6.7 Meselson and Stahl’s Experiment
105
(iii) Thus, the DNA that was extracted from the culture one
generation after the transfer from 15 N to 14 N medium [that is
after 20 minutes; E. coli divides in 20 minutes] had a hybrid or
intermediate density. DNA extracted from the culture after
another generation [that is after 40 minutes, II generation] was
2017-18BIOLOGY
composed of equal amounts of this hybrid DNA and of ‘light’
DNA.
If E. coli was allowed to grow for 80 minutes then what would be the
proportions of light and hybrid densities DNA molecule?
Very similar experiments involving use of radioactive thymidine to
detect distribution of newly synthesised DNA in the chromosomes was
performed on Vicia faba (faba beans) by Taylor and colleagues in 1958.
The experiments proved that the DNA in chromosomes also replicate
semiconservatively.
6.4.2 The Machinery and the Enzymes
106
In living cells, such as E. coli, the process of replication requires a set of
catalysts (enzymes). The main enzyme is referred to as DNA-dependent
DNA polymerase, since it uses a DNA template to catalyse the
polymerisation of deoxynucleotides. These enzymes are highly efficient
enzymes as they have to catalyse polymerisation of a large number of
nucleotides in a very short time. E. coli that has only 4.6 × 10 6 bp (compare
it with human whose diploid content is 6.6 × 10 9 bp), completes the
process of replication within 18 minutes; that means the average rate of
polymerisation has to be approximately 2000 bp per second. Not only do
these polymerases have to be fast, but they also have to catalyse the reaction
with high degree of accuracy. Any mistake during replication would result
into mutations. Furthermore, energetically replication is a very expensive
process. Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates serve dual purposes. In
addition to acting as substrates, they provide energy for polymerisation
reaction (the two terminal phosphates in a deoxynucleoside triphosphates
are high-energy phosphates, same as in case of ATP).
In addition to DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, many additional
enzymes are required to complete the process of replication with high
degree of accuracy. For long DNA molecules, since the two strands of
DNA cannot be separated in its entire length (due to very high energy
requirement), the replication occur within a small opening of the DNA
helix, referred to as replication fork. The DNA-dependent DNA
polymerases catalyse polymerisation only in one direction, that is 5 ' à3 ' .
This creates some additional complications at the replicating fork.
Consequently, on one strand (the template with polarity 3 ' à5 ' ), the
replication is continuous, while on the other (the template with
polarity 5 ' à3 ' ), it is discontinuous. The discontinuously synthesised
fragments are later joined by the enzyme DNA ligase (Figure 6.8).
The DNA polymerases on their own cannot initiate the process of
replication. Also the replication does not initiate randomly at any place
in DNA. There is a definite region in E. coli DNA where the replication
originates. Such regions are termed as origin of replication. It is
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
because of the requirement of the origin of
replication that a piece of DNA if needed to be
propagated during recombinant DNA procedures,
requires a vector. The vectors provide the origin of
replication.
Further, not every detail of replication is
understood well. In eukaryotes, the replication of
DNA takes place at S-phase of the cell-cycle. The
replication of DNA and cell division cycle should be
highly coordinated. A failure in cell division after
DNA replication results into polyploidy(a
chromosomal anomaly). You will learn the detailed
nature of origin and the processes occurring at this
site, in higher classes.
6.5 T RANSCRIPTION
The process of copying genetic information from one
Figure 6.8 Replicating Fork
strand of the DNA into RNA is termed as
transcription. Here also, the principle of
complementarity governs the process of transcription, except the adenosine
now forms base pair with uracil instead of thymine. However, unlike in
the process of replication, which once set in, the total DNA of an organism
gets duplicated, in transcription only a segment of DNA and only one of
the strands is copied into RNA. This necessitates defining the boundaries
that would demarcate the region and the strand of DNA that would be
transcribed.
Why both the strands are not copied during transcription has the
simple answer. First, if both strands act as a template, they would code
for RNA molecule with different sequences (Remember complementarity
does not mean identical), and in turn, if they code for proteins, the sequence
of amino acids in the proteins would be different. Hence, one segment of
the DNA would be coding for two different proteins, and this would
complicate the genetic information transfer machinery. Second, the two
RNA molecules if produced simultaneously would be complementary to
each other, hence would form a double stranded RNA. This would prevent
RNA from being translated into protein and the exercise of transcription
would become a futile one.
6.5.1 Transcription Unit
107
A transcription unit in DNA is defined primarily by the three regions in
the DNA :
(i) A Promoter
(ii) The Structural gene
(iii) A Terminator
2017-18BIOLOGY
There is a convention in defining the two strands of the DNA in the
structural gene of a transcription unit. Since the two strands have opposite
polarity and the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase also catalyse the
polymerisation in only one direction, that is, 5 ' →3 ' , the strand that has
the polarity 3 ' →5 ' acts as a template, and is also referred to as template
strand. The other strand which has the polarity (5 ' →3 ' ) and the sequence
same as RNA (except thymine at the place of uracil), is displaced during
transcription. Strangely, this strand (which does not code for anything)
is referred to as coding strand. All the reference point while defining a
transcription unit is made with coding strand. To explain the point, a
hypothetical sequence from a transcription unit is represented below:
3 ' -ATGCATGCATGCATGCATGCATGC-5 ' Template Strand
5 ' -TACGTACGTACGTACGTACGTACG-3 ' Coding Strand
Can you now write the sequence of RNA transcribed from the above DNA?
Figure 6.9 Schematic structure of a transcription unit
108
The promoter and terminator flank the structural gene in a
transcription unit. The promoter is said to be located towards 5 ' -end
(upstream) of the structural gene (the reference is made with respect to
the polarity of coding strand). It is a DNA sequence that provides binding
site for RNA polymerase, and it is the presence of a promoter in a
transcription unit that also defines the template and coding strands. By
switching its position with terminator, the definition of coding and template
strands could be reversed. The terminator is located towards 3 ' -end
(downstream) of the coding strand and it usually defines the end of the
process of transcription (Figure 6.9). There are additional regulatory
sequences that may be present further upstream or downstream to the
promoter. Some of the properties of these sequences shall be discussed
while dealing with regulation of gene expression.
6.5.2 Transcription Unit and the Gene
A gene is defined as the functional unit of inheritance. Though there is no
ambiguity that the genes are located on the DNA, it is difficult to literally
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
define a gene in terms of DNA sequence. The DNA sequence coding for
tRNA or rRNA molecule also define a gene. However by defining a cistron
as a segment of DNA coding for a polypeptide, the structural gene in a
transcription unit could be said as monocistronic (mostly in eukaryotes)
or polycistronic (mostly in bacteria or prokaryotes). In eukaryotes, the
monocistronic structural genes have interrupted coding sequences – the
genes in eukaryotes are split. The coding sequences or expressed
sequences are defined as exons. Exons are said to be those sequence
that appear in mature or processed RNA. The exons are interrupted by
introns. Introns or intervening sequences do not appear in mature or
processed RNA. The split-gene arrangement further complicates the
definition of a gene in terms of a DNA segment.
Inheritance of a character is also affected by promoter and regulatory
sequences of a structural gene. Hence, sometime the regulatory sequences
are loosely defined as regulatory genes, even though these sequences do
not code for any RNA or protein.
6.5.3 Types of RNA and the process of Transcription
In bacteria, there are three major types of RNAs: mRNA (messenger RNA),
tRNA (transfer RNA), and rRNA (ribosomal RNA). All three RNAs are
needed to synthesise a protein in a cell. The mRNA provides the template,
tRNA brings aminoacids and reads the genetic code, and rRNAs play
structural and catalytic role during translation. There is single
DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that catalyses transcription of all types
of RNA in bacteria. RNA polymerase binds to promoter and initiates
transcription (Initiation). It uses nucleoside triphosphates as substrate
109
Figure 6.10 Process of Transcription in Bacteria
2017-18BIOLOGY
and polymerises in a template depended fashion following the rule of
complementarity. It somehow also facilitates opening of the helix and
continues elongation. Only a short stretch of RNA remains bound to the
enzyme. Once the polymerases reaches the terminator region, the nascent
RNA falls off, so also the RNA polymerase. This results in termination of
transcription.
An intriguing question is that how is the RNA polymerases able
to catalyse all the three steps, which are initiation, elongation and
termination. The RNA polymerase is only capable of catalysing the
process of elongation. It associates transiently with initiation-factor (σ)
and termination-factor (ρ) to initiate and terminate the transcription,
respectively. Association with these factors alter the specificity of the
RNA polymerase to either initiate or terminate (Figure 6.10).
In bacteria, since the mRNA does not require any processing to become
active, and also since transcription and translation take place in the same
compartment (there is no separation of cytosol and nucleus in bacteria),
many times the translation can begin much before the mRNA is fully
transcribed. Consequently, the transcription and translation can be coupled
in bacteria.
In eukaryotes, there are two additional complexities –
(i) There are at least three RNA polymerases in the nucleus (in addition
to the RNA polymerase found in the organelles). There is a clear
cut division of labour. The RNA polymerase I transcribes rRNAs
110
Figure 6.11 Process of Transcription in Eukaryotes
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
(28S, 18S, and 5.8S), whereas the RNA polymerase III is responsible
for transcription of tRNA, 5srRNA, and snRNAs (small nuclear
RNAs). The RNA polymerase II transcribes precursor of mRNA, the
heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA).
(ii) The second complexity is that the primary transcripts contain both
the exons and the introns and are non-functional. Hence, it is
subjected to a process called splicing where the introns are removed
and exons are joined in a defined order. hnRNA undergoes
additional processing called as capping and tailing. In capping an
unusual nucleotide (methyl guanosine triphosphate) is added to
the 5 ' -end of hnRNA. In tailing, adenylate residues (200-300) are
added at 3 ' -end in a template independent manner. It is the fully
processed hnRNA, now called mRNA, that is transported out of the
nucleus for translation (Figure 6.11).
The significance of such complexities is now beginning to be
understood. The split-gene arrangements represent probably an ancient
feature of the genome. The presence of introns is reminiscent of antiquity,
and the process of splicing represents the dominance of RNA-world. In
recent times, the understanding of RNA and RNA-dependent processes
in the living system have assumed more importance.
6.6 G ENETIC C ODE
During replication and transcription a nucleic acid was copied to form
another nucleic acid. Hence, these processes are easy to conceptualise
on the basis of complementarity. The process of translation requires
transfer of genetic information from a polymer of nucleotides to a polymer
of amino acids. Neither does any complementarity exist between
nucleotides and amino acids, nor could any be drawn theoretically. There
existed ample evidences, though, to support the notion that change in
nucleic acids (genetic material) were responsible for change in amino acids
in proteins. This led to the proposition of a genetic code that could direct
the sequence of amino acids during synthesis of proteins.
If determining the biochemical nature of genetic material and the
structure of DNA was very exciting, the proposition and deciphering of
genetic code were most challenging. In a very true sense, it required
involvement of scientists from several disciplines – physicists, organic
chemists, biochemists and geneticists. It was George Gamow, a physicist,
who argued that since there are only 4 bases and if they have to code for
20 amino acids, the code should constitute a combination of bases. He
suggested that in order to code for all the 20 amino acids, the code should
be made up of three nucleotides. This was a very bold proposition, because
a permutation combination of 4 3 (4 × 4 × 4) would generate 64 codons;
generating many more codons than required.
Providing proof that the codon was a triplet, was a more daunting
task. The chemical method developed by Har Gobind Khorana was
111
2017-18BIOLOGY
instrumental in synthesising RNA molecules with defined combinations
of bases (homopolymers and copolymers). Marshall Nirenberg’s cell-free
system for protein synthesis finally helped the code to be deciphered.
Severo Ochoa enzyme (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was also helpful
in polymerising RNA with defined sequences in a template independent
manner (enzymatic synthesis of RNA). Finally a checker-board for genetic
code was prepared which is given in Table 6.1.
Table 6.1: The Codons for the Various Amino Acids
The salient features of genetic code are as follows:
112
(i) The codon is triplet. 61 codons code for amino acids and 3 codons do
not code for any amino acids, hence they function as stop codons.
(ii) One codon codes for only one amino acid, hence, it is
unambiguous and specific.
(iii) Some amino acids are coded by more than one codon, hence
the code is degenerate.
(iv) The codon is read in mRNA in a contiguous fashion. There are
no punctuations.
(v) The code is nearly universal: for example, from bacteria to human
UUU would code for Phenylalanine (phe). Some exceptions to this
rule have been found in mitochondrial codons, and in some
protozoans.
(vi) AUG has dual functions. It codes for Methionine (met) , and it
also act as initiator codon.
If following is the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA, predict the
sequence of amino acid coded by it (take help of the checkerboard):
-AUG UUU UUC UUC UUU UUU UUC-
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
Now try the opposite. Following is the sequence of amino acids coded
by an mRNA. Predict the nucleotide sequence in the RNA:
Met-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe-Phe
Do you face any difficulty in predicting the opposite?
Can you now correlate which two properties of genetic code you have
learnt?
6.6.1 Mutations and Genetic Code
The relationships between genes and DNA are best understood by mutation
studies. You have studied about mutation and its effect in Chapter 5. Effects
of large deletions and rearrangements in a segment of DNA are easy to
comprehend. It may result in loss or gain of a gene and so a function. The
effect of point mutations will be explained here. A classical example of
point mutation is a change of single base pair in the gene for beta globin
chain that results in the change of amino acid residue glutamate to valine.
It results into a diseased condition called as sickle cell anemia. Effect of
point mutations that inserts or deletes a base in structural gene can be
better understood by following simple example.
Consider a statement that is made up of the following words each
having three letters like genetic code.
RAM HAS RED CAP
If we insert a letter B in between HAS and RED and rearrange the
statement, it would read as follows:
RAM HAS BRE DCA P
Similarly, if we now insert two letters at the same place, say BI'. Now it
would read,
RAM HAS BIR EDC AP
Now we insert three letters together, say BIG, the statement would read
RAM HAS BIG RED CAP
The same exercise can be repeated, by deleting the letters R, E and D,
one by one and rearranging the statement to make a triplet word.
RAM HAS EDC AP
RAM HAS DCA P
113
RAM HAS CAP
The conclusion from the above exercise is very obvious. Insertion or
deletion of one or two bases changes the reading frame from the point of
insertion or deletion. However, such mutations are referred to as
2017-18BIOLOGY
frameshift insertion or deletion mutations. Insertion or deletion of
three or its multiple bases insert or delete in one or multiple codon hence
one or multiple amino acids, and reading frame remains unaltered from
that point onwards.
6.6.2 tRNA– the Adapter Molecule
From the very beginning of the proposition of code, it was clear to Francis
Crick that there has to be a mechanism to read the code and also to link it
to the amino acids, because amino acids have no structural specialities to
read the code uniquely. He postulated the presence of an adapter molecule
that would on one hand read the code and on other hand would bind
to specific amino acids. The tRNA, then called sRNA (soluble RNA),
was known before the genetic code was postulated. However, its role
as an adapter molecule was assigned much later.
tRNA has an
anticodon loop
that has bases
complementary to
the code, and it also
has an amino acid
acceptor end to
which it binds to
amino
acids.
tRNAs are specific
for each amino acid
(Figure 6.12). For
Figure 6.12 tRNA - the adapter molecule
initiation, there is
another specific tRNA that is referred to as initiator tRNA. There are no
tRNAs for stop codons. In figure 6.12, the secondary structure of tRNA
has been depicted that looks like a clover-leaf. In actual structure, the
tRNA is a compact molecule which looks like inverted L.
6.7 T RANSLATION
114
Translation refers to the process of polymerisation of amino acids to
form a polypeptide (Figure 6.13). The order and sequence of amino acids
are defined by the sequence of bases in the mRNA. The amino acids are
joined by a bond which is known as a peptide bond. Formation of a
peptide bond requires energy. Therefore, in the first phase itself amino
acids are activated in the presence of ATP and linked to their cognate
tRNA – a process commonly called as charging of tRNA or
aminoacylation of tRNA to be more specific. If two such charged tRNAs
are brought close enough, the formation of peptide bond between them
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
would be favoured energetically. The
presence of a catalyst would enhance
the rate of peptide bond formation.
The cellular factory responsible for
synthesising proteins is the ribosome.
The ribosome consists of structural
RNAs and about 80 different proteins.
In its inactive state, it exists as two
subunits; a large subunit and a small
subunit. When the small subunit
encounters an mRNA, the process of
translation of the mRNA to protein
begins. There are two sites in the large
subunit, for subsequent amino acids
Figure 6.13 Translation
to bind to and thus, be close enough
to each other for the formation of a
peptide bond. The ribosome also acts as a catalyst (23S rRNA in bacteria
is the enzyme- ribozyme) for the formation of peptide bond.
A translational unit in mRNA is the sequence of RNA that is flanked
by the start codon (AUG) and the stop codon and codes for a polypeptide.
An mRNA also has some additional sequences that are not translated
and are referred as untranslated regions (UTR). The UTRs are present
at both 5 ' -end (before start codon) and at 3 ' -end (after stop codon). They
are required for efficient translation process.
For initiation, the ribosome binds to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG)
that is recognised only by the initiator tRNA. The ribosome proceeds to the
elongation phase of protein synthesis. During this stage, complexes
composed of an amino acid linked to tRNA, sequentially bind to the
appropriate codon in mRNA by forming complementary base pairs with
the tRNA anticodon. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the
mRNA. Amino acids are added one by one, translated into Polypeptide
sequences dictated by DNA and represented by mRNA. At the end, a release
factor binds to the stop codon, terminating translation and releasing the
complete polypeptide from the ribosome.
6.8 R EGULATION
OF
G ENE E XPRESSION
Regulation of gene expression refers to a very broad term that may occur
at various levels. Considering that gene expression results in the formation
of a polypeptide, it can be regulated at several levels. In eukaryotes, the
regulation could be exerted at
(i) transcriptional level (formation of primary transcript),
(ii) processing level (regulation of splicing),
(iii) transport of mRNA from nucleus to the cytoplasm,
(iv) translational level.
115
2017-18BIOLOGY
The genes in a cell are expressed to perform a particular function or a
set of functions. For example, if an enzyme called beta-galactosidase is
synthesised by E. coli, it is used to catalyse the hydrolysis of a
disaccharide, lactose into galactose and glucose; the bacteria use them
as a source of energy. Hence, if the bacteria do not have lactose around
them to be utilised for energy source, they would no longer require the
synthesis of the enzyme beta-galactosidase. Therefore, in simple terms,
it is the metabolic, physiological or environmental conditions that regulate
the expression of genes. The development and differentiation of embryo
into adult organisms are also a result of the coordinated regulation of
expression of several sets of genes.
In prokaryotes, control of the rate of transcriptional initiation is the
predominant site for control of gene expression. In a transcription unit,
the activity of RNA polymerase at a given promoter is in turn regulated
by interaction with accessory proteins, which affect its ability to recognise
start sites. These regulatory proteins can act both positively (activators)
and negatively (repressors). The accessibility of promoter regions of
prokaryotic DNA is in many cases regulated by the interaction of proteins
with sequences termed operators. The operator region is adjacent to the
promoter elements in most operons and in most cases the sequences of
the operator bind a repressor protein. Each operon has its specific
operator and specific repressor. For example, lac operator is present
only in the lac operon and it interacts specifically with lac repressor only.
6.8.1 The Lac operon
116
The elucidation of the lac operon was also a result of a close association
between a geneticist, Francois Jacob and a biochemist, Jacque Monod. They
were the first to elucidate a transcriptionally regulated system. In lac operon
(here lac refers to lactose), a polycistronic structural gene is regulated by a
common promoter and regulatory genes. Such arrangement is very common
in bacteria and is referred to as operon. To name few such examples, lac
operon, trp operon, ara operon, his operon, val operon, etc.
The lac operon consists of one regulatory gene (the i gene – here the
term i does not refer to inducer, rather it is derived from the word inhibitor)
and three structural genes (z, y, and a). The i gene codes for the repressor
of the lac operon. The z gene codes for beta-galactosidase ( β -gal), which
is primarily responsible for the hydrolysis of the disaccharide, lactose
into its monomeric units, galactose and glucose. The y gene codes for
permease, which increases permeability of the cell to β -galactosides. The
a gene encodes a transacetylase. Hence, all the three gene products in
lac operon are required for metabolism of lactose. In most other operons
as well, the genes present in the operon are needed together to function
in the same or related metabolic pathway (Figure 6.14).
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
Figure 6.14 The lac Operon
Lactose is the substrate for the enzyme beta-galactosidase and it
regulates switching on and off of the operon. Hence, it is termed as
inducer. In the absence of a preferred carbon source such as glucose, if
lactose is provided in the growth medium of the bacteria, the lactose is
transported into the cells through the action of permease (Remember, a
very low level of expression of lac operon has to be present in the cell all
the time, otherwise lactose cannot enter the cells). The lactose then induces
the operon in the following manner.
The repressor of the operon is synthesised (all-the-time – constitutively)
from the i gene. The repressor protein binds to the operator region of the
operon and prevents RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon. In
the presence of an inducer, such as lactose or allolactose, the repressor is
inactivated by interaction with the inducer. This allows RNA polymerase
access to the promoter and transcription proceeds (Figure 6.14).
Essentially, regulation of lac operon can also be visualised as regulation
of enzyme synthesis by its substrate.
Remember, glucose or galactose cannot act as inducers for lac
operon. Can you think for how long the lac operon would be expressed
in the presence of lactose?
Regulation of lac operon by repressor is referred to as negative
regulation. Lac operon is under control of positive regulation as well,
but it is beyond the scope of discussion at this level.

6.9 H UMAN G ENOME P ROJECT
In the preceding sections you have learnt that it is the sequence of bases in
DNA that determines the genetic information of a given organism. In other
words, genetic make-up of an organism or an individual lies in the DNA
sequences. If two individuals differ, then their DNA sequences should also
be different, at least at some places. These assumptions led to the quest of
finding out the complete DNA sequence of human genome. With the
establishment of genetic engineering techniques where it was possible to
isolate and clone any piece of DNA and availability of simple and fast
techniques for determining DNA sequences, a very ambitious project of
sequencing human genome was launched in the year 1990.
Human Genome Project (HGP) was called a mega project. You can
imagine the magnitude and the requirements for the project if we simply
define the aims of the project as follows:
Human genome is said to have approximately 3 x 10 9 bp, and if the
cost of sequencing required is US $ 3 per bp (the estimated cost in the
beginning), the total estimated cost of the project would be approximately
9 billion US dollars. Further, if the obtained sequences were to be stored
in typed form in books, and if each page of the book contained 1000
letters and each book contained 1000 pages, then 3300 such books would
be required to store the information of DNA sequence from a single human
cell. The enormous amount of data expected to be generated also
necessitated the use of high speed computational devices for data storage
and retrieval, and analysis. HGP was closely associated with the rapid
development of a new area in biology called Bioinformatics.
Goals of HGP
Some of the important goals of HGP were as follows:
(i) Identify all the approximately 20,000-25,000 genes in human DNA;
(ii) Determine the sequences of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that
make up human DNA;
(iiii) Store this information in databases;
(iv) Improve tools for data analysis;
(v) Transfer related technologies to other sectors, such as industries;
118
(vi) Address the ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) that may arise
from the project.
The Human Genome Project was a 13-year project coordinated by
the U.S. Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health. During
the early years of the HGP, the Wellcome Trust (U.K.) became a major
partner; additional contributions came from Japan, France, Germany,
China and others. The project was completed in 2003. Knowledge about
the effects of DNA variations among individuals can lead to revolutionary
new ways to diagnose, treat and someday prevent the thousands of
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
disorders that affect human beings. Besides providing clues to
understanding human biology, learning about non-human organisms
DNA sequences can lead to an understanding of their natural capabilities
that can be applied toward solving challenges in health care, agriculture,
energy production, environmental remediation. Many non-human model
organisms, such as bacteria, yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans (a free living
non-pathogenic nematode), Drosophila (the fruit fly), plants (rice and
Arabidopsis), etc., have also been sequenced.
Methodologies : The methods involved two major approaches. One
approach focused on identifying all the genes that are expressed as
RNA (referred to as Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The other took
the blind approach of simply sequencing the whole set of genome that
contained all the coding and non-coding sequence, and later assigning
different regions in the sequence with functions (a term referred to as
Sequence Annotation). For sequencing, the total DNA from a cell is
isolated and converted into random fragments of relatively smaller sizes
(recall DNA is a very long polymer, and there are technical limitations in
sequencing very long pieces of DNA) and cloned in suitable host using
specialised vectors. The cloning resulted into amplification of each piece
of DNA fragment so that it subsequently could be sequenced with ease.
The commonly used hosts were bacteria and yeast, and the vectors were
called as BAC (bacterial artificial chromosomes), and YAC (yeast artificial
chromosomes).
The fragments were sequenced using automated DNA sequencers that
worked on the principle of a method developed by Frederick Sanger.
(Remember, Sanger is also credited for developing method for
determination of amino acid
sequences in proteins). These
sequences were then arranged based
on some overlapping regions
present in them. This required
generation of overlapping fragments
for sequencing. Alignment of these
sequences was humanly not
possible. Therefore, specialised
computer based programs were
developed (Figure 6.15). These
sequences were subsequently
annotated and were assigned to each
chromosome. The sequence of
chromosome 1 was completed only
in May 2006 (this was the last of the

sequenced). Another challenging task was assigning the genetic and
physical maps on the genome. This was generated using information on
polymorphism of restriction endonuclease recognition sites, and some
repetitive DNA sequences known as microsatellites (one of the applications
of polymorphism in repetitive DNA sequences shall be explained in next
section of DNA fingerprinting).
6.9.1 Salient Features of Human Genome
Some of the salient observations drawn from human genome project are
as follows:
(i) The human genome contains 3164.7 million nucleotide bases.
(ii) The average gene consists of 3000 bases, but sizes vary greatly, with
the largest known human gene being dystrophin at 2.4 million bases.
(iii) The total number of genes is estimated at 30,000– much lower
than previous estimates of 80,000 to 1,40,000 genes. Almost all
(99.9 per cent) nucleotide bases are exactly the same in all people.
(iv) The functions are unknown for over 50 per cent of the discovered
genes.
(v) Less than 2 per cent of the genome codes for proteins.
(vi) Repeated sequences make up very large portion of the human genome.
(vii) Repetitive sequences are stretches of DNA sequences that are
repeated many times, sometimes hundred to thousand times. They
are thought to have no direct coding functions, but they shed light
on chromosome structure, dynamics and evolution.
(viii) Chromosome 1 has most genes (2968), and the Y has the fewest (231).
(ix) Scientists have identified about 1.4 million locations where single-
base DNA differences (SNPs – single nucleotide polymorphism,
pronounced as ‘snips’) occur in humans. This information promises
to revolutionise the processes of finding chromosomal locations for
disease-associated sequences and tracing human history.
6.9.2 Applications and Future Challenges
120
Deriving meaningful knowledge from the DNA sequences will define
research through the coming decades leading to our understanding of
biological systems. This enormous task will require the expertise and
creativity of tens of thousands of scientists from varied disciplines in both
the public and private sectors worldwide. One of the greatest impacts of
having the HG sequence may well be enabling a radically new approach
to biological research. In the past, researchers studied one or a few genes
at a time. With whole-genome sequences and new high-throughput
technologies, we can approach questions systematically and on a much
2017-18MOLECULAR BASIS OF INHERITANCE
broader scale. They can study all the genes in a genome, for example, all
the transcripts in a particular tissue or organ or tumor, or how tens of
thousands of genes and proteins work together in interconnected networks
to orchestrate the chemistry of life.
6.10 DNA F INGERPRINTING
As stated in the preceding section, 99.9 per cent of base sequence among
humans is the same. Assuming human genome as 3 × 10 9 bp, in how
many base sequences would there be differences? It is these differences
in sequence of DNA which make every individual unique in their
phenotypic appearance. If one aims to find out genetic differences
between two individuals or among individuals of a population,
sequencing the DNA every time would be a daunting and expensive
6
task. Imagine trying to compare two sets of 3 × 10 base pairs. DNA
fingerprinting is a very quick way to compare the DNA sequences of any
two individuals.
DNA fingerprinting involves identifying differences in some specific
regions in DNA sequence called as repetitive DNA, because in these
sequences, a small stretch of DNA is repeated many times. These repetitive
DNA are separated from bulk genomic DNA as different peaks during
density gradient centrifugation. The bulk DNA forms a major peak and
the other small peaks are referred to as satellite DNA. Depending on
base composition (A : T rich or G:C rich), length of segment, and number
of repetitive units, the satellite DNA is classified into many categories,
such as micro-satellites, mini-satellites etc. These sequences normally
do not code for any proteins, but they form a large portion of human
genome. These sequence show high degree of polymorphism and form
the basis of DNA fingerprinting. Since DNA from every tissue (such as
blood, hair-follicle, skin, bone, saliva, sperm etc.), from an individual
show the same degree of polymorphism, they become very useful
identification tool in forensic applications. Further, as the polymorphisms
are inheritable from parents to children, DNA fingerprinting is the basis
of paternity testing, in case of disputes.
As polymorphism in DNA sequence is the basis of genetic mapping
of human genome as well as of DNA fingerprinting, it is essential that we
understand what DNA polymorphism means in simple terms.
Polymorphism (variation at genetic level) arises due to mutations. (Recall
different kind of mutations and their effects that you have already
studied in Chapter 5, and in the preceding sections in this chapter.)
New mutations may arise in an individual either in somatic cells or in
the germ cells (cells that generate gametes in sexually reproducing
organisms). If a germ cell mutation does not seriously impair individual’s
ability to have offspring who can transmit the mutation, it can spread to
121
2017-18BIOLOGY
the other members of population (through sexual reproduction). Allelic
(again recall the definition of alleles from Chapter 5) sequence variation
has traditionally been described as a DNA polymorphism if more than
one variant (allele) at a locus occurs in human population with a
frequency greater than 0.01. In simple terms, if an inheritable mutation
is observed in a population at high frequency, it is referred to as DNA
polymorphism. The probability of such variation to be observed in non-
coding DNA sequence would be higher as mutations in these sequences
may not have any immediate effect/impact in an individual’s
reproductive ability. These mutations keep on accumulating generation
after generation, and form one of the basis of variability/polymorphism.
There is a variety of different types of polymorphisms ranging from single
nucleotide change to very large scale changes. For evolution and
speciation, such polymorphisms play very important role, and you will
study these in details at higher classes.
The technique of DNA Fingerprinting was initially developed by Alec
Jeffreys. He used a satellite DNA as probe that shows very high degree
of polymorphism. It was called as Variable Number of Tandem Repeats
(VNTR). The technique, as used earlier, involved Southern blot
hybridisation using radiolabelled VNTR as a probe. It included
(i) isolation of DNA,
(ii) digestion of DNA by restriction endonucleases,
(iii) separation of DNA fragments by electrophoresis,
(iv) transferring (blotting) of separated DNA fragments to synthetic
membranes, such as nitrocellulose or nylon,
(v) hybridisation using labelled VNTR probe, and
(vi) detection of hybridised DNA fragments by autoradiography. A schematic
representation of DNA fingerprinting is shown in Figure 6.16.
122
The VNTR belongs to a class of satellite DNA referred to as mini-satellite.
A small DNA sequence is arranged tandemly in many copy numbers. The
copy number varies from chromosome to chromosome in an individual.
The numbers of repeat show very high degree of polymorphism. As a
result the size of VNTR varies in size from 0.1 to
20 kb. Consequently, after hybridisation with VNTR probe, the
autoradiogram gives many bands of differing sizes. These bands give a
characteristic pattern for an individual DNA (Figure 6.16). It differs from
individual to individual in a population except in the case of monozygotic
(identical) twins. The sensitivity of the technique has been increased by
use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR–you will study about it in
Chapter 11). Consequently, DNA from a single cell is enough to perform
DNA fingerprinting analysis. In addition to application in forensic

have been shown to contain different copy number of VNTR. For the sake of

science, it has much wider application, such as in determining
population and genetic diversities. Currently, many different probes
are used to generate DNA fingerprints.

SUMMARY
124
Nucleic acids are long polymers of nucleotides. While DNA stores genetic
information, RNA mostly helps in transfer and expression of information.
Though DNA and RNA both function as genetic material, but DNA being
chemically and structurally more stable is a better genetic material.
However, RNA is the first to evolve and DNA was derived from RNA. The
hallmark of the double stranded helical structure of DNA is the hydrogen
bonding between the bases from opposite strands. The rule is that
Adenine pairs with Thymine through two H-bonds, and Guanine with
Cytosine through three H-bonds.
This makes one strand
complementary to the other. The DNA replicates semiconservatively,
the process is guided by the complementary H-bonding. A segment of
DNA that codes for RNA may in a simplistic term can be referred as
gene. During transcription also, one of the strands of DNA acts a
template to direct the synthesis of complementary RNA. In bacteria,
the transcribed mRNA is functional, hence can directly be translated.
In eukaryotes, the gene is split. The coding sequences, exons, are
interrupted by non-coding sequences, introns. Introns are removed
and exons are joined to produce functional RNA by splicing. The
messenger RNA contains the base sequences that are read in a
combination of three (to make triplet genetic code) to code for an amino
acid. The genetic code is read again on the principle of complementarity
by tRNA that acts as an adapter molecule. There are specific tRNAs for
every amino acid. The tRNA binds to specific amino acid at one end
and pairs through H-bonding with codes on mRNA through its
anticodons. The site of translation (protein synthesis) is ribosomes,
which bind to mRNA and provide platform for joining of amino acids.
One of the rRNA acts as a catalyst for peptide bond formation, which is
an example of RNA enzyme (ribozyme). Translation is a process that
has evolved around RNA, indicating that life began around RNA. Since,
transcription and translation are energetically very expensive
processes, these have to be tightly regulated. Regulation of transcription
is the primary step for regulation of gene expression. In bacteria, more
than one gene is arranged together and regulated in units called as
operons. Lac operon is the prototype operon in bacteria, which codes
for genes responsible for metabolism of lactose. The operon is regulated
by the amount of lactose in the medium where the bacteria are grown.
Therefore, this regulation can also be viewed as regulation of enzyme
synthesis by its substrate.
Human genome project was a mega project that aimed to sequence
every base in human genome. This project has yielded much new
information. Many new areas and avenues have opened up as a
consequence of the project. DNA Fingerprinting is a technique to find
out variations in individuals of a population at DNA level. It works on
the principle of polymorphism in DNA sequences. It has immense
applications in the field of forensic science, genetic biodiversity and
evolutionary biology.

Origin and Evolution of
Man
Evolutionary Biology is the study of history of life forms
on earth. What exactly is evolution? To understand the
changes in flora and fauna that have occurred over millions
of years on earth, we must have an understanding of the
context of origin of life, i.e., evolution of earth, of stars and
indeed of the universe itself. What follows is the longest of
all the construed and conjectured stories. This is the story
of origin of life and evolution of life forms or biodiversity on
planet earth in the context of evolution of earth and against
the background of evolution of universe itself.
7.1 O RIGIN
OF
L IFE
When we look at stars on a clear night sky we are, in a
way, looking back in time. Stellar distances are measured
in light years. What we see today is an object whose emitted
light started its journey millions of year back and from
trillions of kilometres away and reaching our eyes now.
However, when we see objects in our immediate
surroundings we see them instantly and hence in the
present time. Therefore, when we see stars we apparently
are peeping into the past.
The origin of life is considered a unique event in the
history of universe. The universe is vast. Relatively speaking
2017-18EVOLUTION
the earth itself is almost only a speck. The universe is very
old – almost 20 billion years old. Huge clusters of galaxies comprise the
universe. Galaxies contain stars and clouds of gas and dust. Considering
the size of universe, earth is indeed a speck. The Big Bang theory attempts
to explain to us the origin of universe. It talks of a singular huge explosion
unimaginable in physical terms. The universe expanded and hence, the
temperature came down. Hydrogen and Helium formed sometime later.
The gases condensed under gravitation and formed the galaxies of the
present day universe. In the solar system of the milky way galaxy, earth
was supposed to have been formed about 4.5 billion years back. There
was no atmosphere on early earth. Water vapour, methane, carbondioxide
and ammonia released from molten mass covered the surface. The UV rays
from the sun brokeup water into Hydrogen and Oxygen and the lighter H 2
escaped. Oxygen combined with ammonia and methane to form water,
CO 2 and others. The ozone layer was formed. As it cooled, the water vapor
fell as rain, to fill all the depressions and form oceans. Life appeared 500
million years after the formation of earth, i.e., almost four billion years back.
Did life come from outerspace? Some scientists believe that it came
from outside. Early Greek thinkers thought units of life called spores
were transferred to different planets including earth. ‘Panspermia’ is still
a favourite idea for some astronomers. For a long time it was also believed
that life came out of decaying and rotting matter like straw, mud, etc.
This was the theory of spontaneous generation. Louis Pasteur by careful
experimentation demonstrated that life comes only from pre-existing life.
He showed that in pre-sterilised flasks, life did not come from killed yeast
while in another flask open to air, new living organisms arose from ‘killed
yeast’. Spontaneous generation theory was dismissed once and for all.
However, this did not answer how the first life form came on earth.
Oparin of Russia and Haldane of England proposed that the first form
of life could have come from pre-existing non-living organic molecules
(e.g. RNA, protein, etc.) and that formation of life was preceded by chemical
evolution, i.e., formation of diverse organic molecules from inorganic
constituents. The conditions on earth were – high temperature, volcanic
storms, reducing atmosphere containing CH 4 , NH 3 , etc. In 1953, S.L. Miller,
an American scientist created similar conditions in a laboratory scale
(Figure 7.1). He created electric discharge in a closed flask containing
CH 4 , H 2 , NH 3 and water vapour at 800 0 C. He observed formation of amino
acids. In similar experiments others observed, formation of sugars,
nitrogen bases, pigment and fats. Analysis of meteorite content also
revealed similar compounds indicating that similar processes are
occurring elsewhere in space. With this limited evidence, the first part of
the conjectured story, i.e., chemical evolution was more or less accepted.
We have no idea about how the first self replicating metabolic capsule
of life arose. The first non-cellular forms of life could have originated
127
2017-18BIOLOGY
Figure 7.1 Diagrammatic representation of Miller’s
experiment
3 billion years back. They would have been giant molecules (RNA, Protein,
Polysaccharides, etc.). These capsules reproduced their molecules perhaps.
The first cellular form of life did not possibly originate till about 2000
million years ago. These were probably single-cells. All life forms were in
water environment only. This version of a biogenesis, i.e., the first form of
life arose slowly through evolutionary forces from non-living molecules is
accepted by majority. However, once formed, how the first cellular forms
of life could have evolved into the complex biodiversity of today is the
fascinating story that will be discussed below.
7.2 E VOLUTION

OF
L IFE F ORMS – A T HEORY
Conventional religious literature tells us about the theory of special
creation. This theory has three connotations. One, that all living organisms
(species or types) that we see today were created as such. Two, that the
diversity was always the same since creation and will be the same in future
also. Three, that earth is about 4000 years old. All these ideas were
strongly challenged during the nineteenth century. Based on observations
made during a sea voyage in a sail ship called H.M.S. Beagle round the
world, Charles Darwin concluded that existing living forms share
similarities to varying degrees not only among themselves but also with
life forms that existed millions of years ago. Many such life forms do not
exist any more. There had been extinctions of different life forms in the
2017-18EVOLUTION
years gone by just as new forms of life arose at different periods of history
of earth. There has been gradual evolution of life forms. Any population
has built in variation in characteristics. Those characteristics which enable
some to survive better in natural conditions (climate, food, physical factors,
etc.) would outbreed others that are less-endowed to survive under such
natural conditions. Another word used is fitness of the individual or
population. The fitness, according to Darwin, refers ultimately and only
to reproductive fitness. Hence, those who are better fit in an environment,
leave more progeny than others. These, therefore, will survive more and
hence are selected by nature. He called it natural selection and implied it
as a mechanism of evolution. Let us also remember that Alfred Wallace, a
naturalist who worked in Malay Archipelago had also come to similar
conclusions around the same time. In due course of time, apparently new
types of organisms are recognisable. All the existing life forms share
similarities and share common ancestors. However, these ancestors were
present at different periods in the history of earth (epochs, periods and
eras). The geological history of earth closely correlates with the biological
history of earth. A common permissible conclusion is that earth is very
old, not thousand of years as was thought earlier but billions of years old.
7.3 W HAT ARE THE E VIDENCES FOR E VOLUTION ?
Evidence that evolution of life forms has indeed taken place on earth has
come from many quarters. Fossils are remains of hard parts of
life-forms found in rocks. Rocks form sediments and a cross-section of
earth's crust indicates the arrangement of sediments one over the other
during the long history of earth. Different-aged rock sediments contain
fossils of different life-forms who probably died during the formation of
the particular sediment. Some of them appear similar to modern
organisms (Figure 7.2). They represent extinct organisms (e.g., Dinosaurs).
A study of fossils in different sedimentary layers indicates the geological
period in which they existed. The study showed that life-forms varied
over time and certain life forms are restricted to certain geological time-
spans. Hence, new forms of life have arisen at different times in the history
of earth. All this is called paleontological evidence. Do you remember
how the ages of the fossils are calculated? Do you recollect the method
of radioactive-dating and the principles behind the procedure? (Please
see Page 289 also)
Comparative anatomy and morphology shows similarities and
differences among organisms of today and those that existed years ago.
Such similarities can be interpreted to understand whether common
ancestors were shared or not. For example whales, bats, Cheetah and
human (all mammals) share similarities in the pattern of bones of forelimbs
(Figure 7.3b). Though these forelimbs perform different functions in these
animals, they have similar anatomical structure – all of them have
129
2017-18BIOLOGY
Figure 7.2 A family tree of dinosaurs and their living modern day counterpart organisms like
crocodiles and birds
130
humerus, radius, ulna, carpals, metacarpals and phalanges in their
forelimbs. Hence, in these animals, the same structure developed along
different directions due to adaptations to different needs. This is divergent
evolution and these structures are homologous. Homology indicates
common ancestry. Other examples are vertebrate hearts or brains. In
plants also, the thorn and tendrils of Bougainvillea and Cucurbita
represent homology (Figure 7.3a). Homology is based on divergent
evolution whereas analogy refers to a situation exactly opposite. Wings of
butterfly and of birds look alike. They are not anatomically similar
2017-18EVOLUTION
structures though they perform similar
functions. Hence, analogous structures
are a result of convergent evolution -
different structures evolving for the same
Tendril
function and hence having similarity.
Other examples of analogy are the eye of
the octopus and of mammals or the
flippers of Penguins and Dolphins. One
can say that it is the similar habitat that
has resulted in selection of similar
adaptive features in different groups of
organisms but toward the same function:
(a)
Sweet potato (root modification) and
potato (stem modification) is another
example for analogy.
In the same line of argument,
similarities in proteins and genes
performing a given function among
diverse organisms give clues to common
ancestry. These biochemical similarities
point to the same shared ancestry as
structural similarities among diverse
organisms.
Man has bred selected plants and
animals for agriculture, horticulture, sport
or security. Man has domesticated many
wild animals and crops. This intensive
breeding programme has created breeds
that differ from other breeds (e.g., dogs) but
still are of the same group. It is argued that
if within hundreds of years, man could
create new breeds, could not nature have
(b)
done the same over millions of years?
Another interesting observation
Figure 7.3 Example of homologous organs in
supporting evolution by natural selection
(a) Plants and (b) Animals
comes from England. In a collection of
moths made in 1850s, i.e., before industrialisation set in, it was observed
that there were more white-winged moths on trees than dark-winged or
melanised moths. However, in the collection carried out from the same
131
area, but after industrialisation, i.e., in 1920, there were more dark-winged
moths in the same area, i.e., the proportion was reversed.
The explanation put forth for this observation was that ‘predators will
spot a moth against a contrasting background’. During post-
industrialisation period, the tree trunks became dark due to industrial
smoke and soots. Under this condition the white-winged moth did not

(b)
Figure 7.4 Figure showing white - winged moth and dark - winged moth (melanised)

survive due to predators, dark-winged or melanised moth survived. Before
industrialisation set in, thick growth of almost white-coloured lichen
covered the trees - in that background the white winged moth survived
but the dark-coloured moth were picked out by predators. Do you know
that lichens can be used as industrial pollution indicators? They will
not grow in areas that are polluted. Hence, moths that were able to
camouflage themselves, i.e., hide in the background, survived
(Figure 7.4). This understanding is supported by the fact that in areas
where industrialisation did not occur e.g., in rural areas, the count of
melanic moths was low. This showed that in a mixed population, those
that can better-adapt, survive and increase in population size. Remember
that no variant is completely wiped out.
Similarly, excess use of herbicides, pesticides, etc., has only resulted
in selection of resistant varieties in a much lesser time scale. This is also
true for microbes against which we employ antibiotics or drugs against
eukaryotic organisms/cell. Hence, resistant organisms/cells are appearing
in a time scale of months or years and not centuries. These are examples
of evolution by anthropogenic action. This also tells us that evolution is not
a directed process in the sense of determinism. It is a stochastic process
based on chance events in nature and chance mutation in the organisms.

IS
A DAPTIVE R ADIATION ?
During his journey Darwin went to Galapagos Islands. There he observed
an amazing diversity of creatures. Of particular interest, small black birds
later called Darwin’s Finches amazed him. He realised that there were many
varieties of finches in the same island. All the varieties, he conjectured,
evolved on the island itself. From the original seed-eating features, many
other forms with altered beaks arose, enabling them to become insectivorous
2017-18EVOLUTION
Figure 7.5 Variety of beaks of finches that Darwin found in Galapagos Island
and vegetarian finches (Figure 7.5). This process of evolution of different
species in a given geographical area starting from a point and literally
radiating to other areas of geography (habitats) is called adaptive radiation.
Darwin’s finches represent one of the best examples of this phenomenon.
Another example is Australian marsupials. A number of marsupials, each
different from the other (Figure 7.6) evolved from an ancestral stock, but
all within the Australian island continent. When more than one adaptive
radiation appeared to have occurred in an isolated geographical area
(representing different habitats), one can call this convergent evolution.
133
Figure 7.6 Adaptive radiation of marsupials of Australia
2017-18BIOLOGY
Placental mammals in Australia also exhibit
adaptive radiation in evolving into varieties
of such placental mammals each of which
appears to be ‘similar’ to a corresponding
marsupial (e.g., Placental wolf and Tasmanian
wolf-marsupial). (Figure 7.7).
7.5 B IOLOGICAL E VOLUTION
Figure 7.7
134
Evolution by natural selection, in a true sense
would have started when cellular forms of life
with differences in metabolic capability
originated on earth.
The essence of Darwinian theory about
evolution is natural selection. The rate of
appearance of new forms is linked to the life
cycle or the life span. Microbes that divide fast
have the ability to multiply and become millions
of individuals within hours. A colony of bacteria
(say A) growing on a given medium has built-
in variation in terms of ability to utilise a feed
component. A change in the medium
composition would bring out only that part of
the population (say B) that can survive under
the new conditions. In due course of time this
variant population outgrows the others and
appears as new species. This would happen
within days. For the same thing to happen in a
fish or fowl would take million of years as life
spans of these animals are in years. Here we
say that fitness of B is better than that of A under
the new conditions. Nature selects for fitness.
Picture showing convergent evolution
One must remember that the so-called fitness
of Australian Marsupials and
is based on characteristics which are inherited.
placental mammals
Hence, there must be a genetic basis for getting
selected and to evolve. Another way of saying the same thing is that some
organisms are better adapted to survive in an otherwise hostile environment.
Adaptive ability is inherited. It has a genetic basis. Fitness is the end result
of the ability to adapt and get selected by nature.
Branching descent and natural selection are the two key concepts
of Darwinian Theory of Evolution (Figures 7.7 and 7.8).
Even before Darwin, a French naturalist Lamarck had said that
evolution of life forms had occurred but driven by use and disuse of
organs. He gave the examples of Giraffes who in an attempt to forage
2017-18EVOLUTION
leaves on tall trees had to adapt by elongation of their necks. As they
passed on this acquired character of elongated neck to succeeding
generations, Giraffes, slowly, over the years, came to acquire long
necks. Nobody believes this conjecture any more.
Is evolution a process or the result of a process? The world we see,
inanimate and animate, is only the success stories of evolution. When we
describe the story of this world we describe evolution as a process. On the
other hand when we describe the story of life on earth, we treat evolution
as a consequence of a process called natural selection. We are still not
very clear whether to regard evolution and natural selection as processes
or end result of unknown processes.
It is possible that the work of Thomas Malthus on populations
influenced Darwin. Natural selection is based on certain observations
which are factual. For example, natural resources are limited, populations
are stable in size except for seasonal fluctuation, members of a population
vary in characteristics (infact no two individuals are alike) even though
they look superficially similar, most of variations are inherited etc. The
fact that theoretically population size will grow exponentially if everybody
reproduced maximally (this fact can be seen in a growing bacterial
population) and the fact that population sizes in reality are limited, means
that there had been competition for resources. Only some survived and
grew at the cost of others that could not flourish. The novelty and brilliant
insight of Darwin was this: he asserted that variations, which are heritable
and which make resource utilisation better for few (adapted to habitat
better) will enable only those to reproduce and leave more progeny. Hence
for a period of time, over many generations, survivors will leave more
progeny and there would be a change in population characteristic and
hence new forms appear to arise.
7.6 M ECHANISM
OF
E VOLUTION
What is the origin of this variation and how does speciation occur? Even
though Mendel had talked of inheritable 'factors' influencing phenotype,
Darwin either ignored these observations or kept silence. In the first decade
of twentieth century, Hugo deVries based on his work on evening primrose
brought forth the idea of mutations – large difference arising suddenly in
a population. He believed that it is mutation which causes evolution and
not the minor variations (heritable) that Darwin talked about. Mutations
are random and directionless while Darwinian variations are small and
directional. Evolution for Darwin was gradual while deVries believed
mutation caused speciation and hence called it saltation (single step
large mutation). Studies in population genetics, later, brought out
some clarity.

In a given population one can find out the frequency of occurrence of
alleles of a gene or a locus. This frequency is supposed to remain fixed
and even remain the same through generations. Hardy-Weinberg principle
stated it using algebraic equations.
This principle says that allele frequencies in a population are stable
and is constant from generation to generation. The gene pool (total genes
and their alleles in a population) remains a constant. This is called genetic
equilibrium. Sum total of all the allelic frequencies is 1. Individual

frequencies, for example, can be named p, q, etc. In a diploid, p and q
represent the frequency of allele A and allele a . The frequency of AA
individuals in a population is simply p 2 . This is simply stated in another
ways, i.e., the probability that an allele A with a frequency of p appear on
both the chromosomes of a diploid individual is simply the product
of the probabilities, i.e., p 2 . Similarly of aa is q 2 , of Aa 2pq. Hence,
p 2 +2pq+q 2 =1. This is a binomial expansion of (p+q) 2 . When frequency
measured, differs from expected values, the difference (direction) indicates
the extent of evolutionary change. Disturbance in genetic equilibrium, or
Hardy- Weinberg equilibrium, i.e., change of frequency of alleles in a
population would then be interpreted as resulting in evolution.
Five factors are known to affect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These
are gene migration or gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, genetic
recombination and natural selection. When migration of a section of
population to another place and population occurs, gene frequencies
change in the original as well as in the new population. New genes/alleles
are added to the new population and these are lost from the old population.
There would be a gene flow if this gene migration, happens multiple times.
If the same change occurs by chance, it is called genetic drift. Sometimes
the change in allele frequency is so different in the new sample of population
that they become a different species. The original drifted population
becomes founders and the effect is called founder effect.
Microbial experiments show that pre-existing advantageous
mutations when selected will result in observation of new phenotypes.
Over few generations, this would result in Speciation. Natural selection is
a process in which heritable variations enabling better survival are enabled
to reproduce and leave greater number of progeny. A critical analysis
makes us believe that variation due to mutation or variation due to
recombination during gametogenesis, or due to gene flow or genetic drift
results in changed frequency of genes and alleles in future generation.
Coupled to enhance reproductive success, natural selection makes it look
like different population. Natural selection can lead to stabilisation (in
which more individuals acquire mean character value), directional change
(more individuals acquire value other than the mean character value) or
disruption (more individuals acquire peripheral character value at both
ends of the distribution curve) (Figure 7.8).

About 2000 million years ago (mya) the first cellular forms of life appeared
on earth. The mechanism of how non-cellular aggregates of giant

not known. Some of these cells had the ability to release O 2 . The reaction

could have been similar to the light reaction in photosynthesis where water
is split with the help of solar energy captured and channelised by
appropriate light harvesting pigments. Slowly single-celled organisms
became multi-cellular life forms. By the time of 500 mya, invertebrates
were formed and active. Jawless fish probably evolved around 350 mya.
Sea weeds and few plants existed probably around 320 mya. We are told
that the first organisms that invaded land were plants. They were
widespread on land when animals invaded land. Fish with stout and strong
fins could move on land and go back to water. This was about 350 mya. In
1938, a fish caught in South Africa happened to be a Coelacanth which
was thought to be extinct. These animals called lobefins evolved into the

first amphibians that lived on both land and water. There are no specimens
of these left with us. However, these were ancestors of modern day frogs
and salamanders. The amphibians evolved into reptiles. They lay thick-
shelled eggs which do not dry up in sun unlike those of amphibians. Again
we only see their modern day descendents, the turtles, tortoises and
crocodiles. In the next 200 millions years or so, reptiles of different shapes
2017-18BIOLOGY
and sizes dominated on earth. Giant ferns (pteridophytes) were present
but they all fell to form coal deposits slowly. Some of these land reptiles
went back into water to evolve into fish like reptiles probably 200 mya
(e.g. Ichthyosaurs). The land reptiles were, of course, the dinosaurs. The
biggest of them, i.e., Tyrannosaurus rex was about 20 feet in height and
had huge fearsome dagger like teeth. About 65 mya, the dinosaurs
suddenly disappeared from the earth. We do not know the true reason.
Some say climatic changes killed them. Some say most of them evolved
into birds. The truth may live in between. Small sized reptiles of that era
still exist today.
The first mammals were like shrews. Their fossils are small sized.
Mammals were viviparous and protected their unborn young inside the
mother’s body. Mammals were more intelligent in sensing and avoiding
danger at least. When reptiles came down mammals took over this earth.
There were in South America mammals resembling horse, hippopotamus,
bear, rabbit, etc. Due to continental drift, when South America joined
North America, these animals were overridden by North American fauna.
Due to the same continental drift pouched mammals of Australia survived
because of lack of competition from any other mammal.
Lest we forget, some mammals live wholly in water. Whales, dolphins,
seals and sea cows are some examples. Evolution of horse, elephant, dog,
etc., are special stories of evolution. You will learn about these in higher
classes. The most successful story is the evolution of man with language
skills and self-consciousness.

About 15 mya, primates called Dryopithecus and Ramapithecus were
existing. They were hairy and walked like gorillas and chimpanzees.
Ramapithecus was more man-like while Dryopithecus was more
ape-like. Few fossils of man-like bones have been discovered in Ethiopia
and Tanzania (Figure 7.11). These revealed hominid features leading to
the belief that about 3-4 mya, man-like primates walked in eastern Africa.
They were probably not taller than 4 feet but walked up right. Two mya,
Australopithecines probably lived in East African grasslands. Evidence
shows they hunted with stone weapons but essentially ate fruit. Some of
the bones among the bones discovered were different. This creature was
called the first human-like being the hominid and was called Homo habilis.

Homo sapiens arose in Africa and moved across continents and developed
into distinct races. During ice age between 75,000-10,000 years ago
modern Homo sapiens arose. Pre-historic cave art developed about
18,000 years ago. Agriculture came around 10,000 years back and
human settlements started. The rest of what happened is part of human

SUMMARY
The origin of life on earth can be understood only against the
background of origin of universe especially earth. Most scientists
believe chemical evolution, i.e., formation of biomolecules preceded
the appearance of the first cellular forms of life. The subsequent events
as to what happened to the first form of life is a conjectured story
based on Darwinian ideas of organic evolution by natural selection.
Diversity of life forms on earth has been changing over millions of
years. It is generally believed that variations in a population result in
variable fitness. Other phenomena like habitat fragmentation and
genetic drift may accentuate these variations leading to appearance
of new species and hence evolution. Homology is accounted for by the
idea of branching descent. Study of comparative anatomy, fossils and
comparative biochemistry provides evidence for evolution. Among the
stories of evolution of individual species, the story of evolution of
modern man is most interesting and appears to parallel evolution of
human brain and language.

Biology is the youngest of the formalised disciplines of natural

faster than in Biology. Applications of physics and chemistry in
our daily life also have a higher visibility than those of biology.
However, twentieth century and certainly twenty-first century
has demonstrated the utility of biological knowledge in
furthering human welfare, be it in health sector or agriculture.
The discovery of antibiotics, and synthetic plant-derived drugs,
anaesthetics have changed medical practice on one hand
and human health on the other hand. Life expectancy of
human beings have dramatically changed over the years.
Agricultural practices, food processing and diagnostics have
brought socio-cultural changes in human communities. These
are briefly described in the following three chapters of this unit.M.S. S WAMINATHAN

Humans

8.5 Drugs and Alcohol Abuse
Health, for a long time, was considered as a state of body
and mind where there was a balance of certain ‘humors’.
This is what early Greeks like Hippocrates as well as
Indian Ayurveda system of medicine asserted. It was
thought that persons with ‘blackbile’ belonged to hot
personality and would have fevers. This idea was arrived
at by pure reflective thought. The discovery of blood
circulation by William Harvey using experimental method
and the demonstration of normal body temperature in
persons with blackbile using thermometer disproved the
‘good humor’ hypothesis of health. In later years, biology
stated that mind influences, through neural system and
endocrine system, our immune system and that our
immune system maintains our health. Hence, mind and
mental state can affect our health. Of course, health is
affected by –
(i) genetic disorders – deficiencies with which a child is
born and deficiencies/defects which the child inherits
from parents from birth;
(ii) infections and
(iii) life style including food and water we take, rest and
exercise we give to our bodies, habits that we have or
lack etc.BIOLOGY
The term health is very frequently used by everybody. How do we
define it? Health does not simply mean ‘absence of disease’ or ‘physical
fitness’. It could be defined as a state of complete physical, mental and
social well-being. When people are healthy, they are more efficient at
work. This increases productivity and brings economic prosperity. Health
also increases longevity of people and reduces infant and maternal
mortality.
Balanced diet, personal hygiene and regular exercise are very important
to maintain good health. Yoga has been practised since time immemorial
to achieve physical and mental health. Awareness about diseases and
their effect on different bodily functions, vaccination (immunisation)
against infectious diseases, proper disposal of wastes, control of vectors
and maintenance of hygienic food and water resources are necessary for
achieving good health.
When the functioning of one or more organs or systems of the body is
adversely affected, characterised by various signs and symptoms, we say
that we are not healthy, i.e., we have a disease. Diseases can be broadly
grouped into infectious and non-infectious. Diseases which are easily
transmitted from one person to another, are called infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases are very common and every one of us suffers from
these at sometime or other. Some of the infectious diseases like AIDS are
fatal. Among non-infectious diseases, cancer is the major cause of death.
Drug and alcohol abuse also affect our health adversely.

A wide range of organisms belonging to bacteria, viruses, fungi,
protozoans, helminths, etc., could cause diseases in man. Such disease-
causing organisms are called pathogens. Most parasites are therefore
pathogens as they cause harm to the host by living in (or on) them. The
pathogens can enter our body by various means, multiply and interfere
with normal vital activities, resulting in morphological and functional
damage. Pathogens have to adapt to life within the environment of the
host. For example, the pathogens that enter the gut must know a way of
surviving in the stomach at low pH and resisting the various digestive
enzymes. A few representative members from different groups of
pathogenic organisms are discussed here alongwith the diseases caused
by them. Preventive and control measures against these diseases in general,
are also briefly described.
Salmonella typhi is a pathogenic bacterium which causes typhoid
fever in human beings. These pathogens generally enter the small intestine
through food and water contaminated with them and migrate to other
organs through blood. Sustained high fever (39° to 40°C), weakness,
stomach pain, constipation, headache and loss of appetite are some of
the common symptoms of this disease. Intestinal perforation and death
may occur in severe cases. Typhoid fever could be confirmed byHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
Widal test. A classic case in medicine, that of Mary Mallon nicknamed
Typhoid Mary, is worth mentioning here. She was a cook by profession
and was a typhoid carrier who continued to spread typhoid for several
years through the food she prepared.
Bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae
are responsible for the disease pneumonia in humans which infects the
alveoli (air filled sacs) of the lungs. As a result of the infection, the alveoli
get filled with fluid leading to severe problems in respiration. The symptoms
of pneumonia include fever, chills, cough and headache. In severe cases,
the lips and finger nails may turn gray to bluish in colour. A healthy
person acquires the infection by inhaling the droplets/aerosols released
by an infected person or even by sharing glasses and utensils with an
infected person. Dysentery, plague, diphtheria, etc., are some of the other
bacterial diseases in man.
Many viruses also cause diseases in human beings. Rhino viruses
represent one such group of viruses which cause one of the most infectious
human ailments – the common cold. They infect the nose and respiratory
passage but not the lungs. The common cold is characterised by nasal
congestion and discharge, sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache,
tiredness, etc., which usually last for 3-7 days. Droplets resulting from
cough or sneezes of an infected person are either inhaled directly or
transmitted through contaminated objects such as pens, books, cups,
doorknobs, computer keyboard or mouse, etc., and cause infection in a
healthy person.
Some of the human diseases are caused by protozoans too. You might
have heard about malaria, a disease man has been fighting since many
years. Plasmodium, a tiny protozoan is responsible for this disease. Different
species of Plasmodium (P. vivax, P. malaria and P. falciparum) are
responsible for different types of malaria. Of these, malignant malaria caused
by Plasmodium falciparum is the most serious one and can even be fatal.
Let us take a glance at the life cycle of Plasmodium (Figure 8.1).
Plasmodium enters the human body as sporozoites (infectious form)
through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquito. The parasites
initially multiply within the liver cells and then attack the red blood cells
(RBCs) resulting in their rupture. The rupture of RBCs is associated with
release of a toxic substance, haemozoin, which is responsible for the chill
and high fever recurring every three to four days. When a female Anopheles
mosquito bites an infected person, these parasites enter the mosquito’s
body and undergo further development. The parasites multiply within
them to form sporozoites that are stored in their salivary glands. When
these mosquitoes bite a human, the sporozoites are introduced into his/
her body, thereby initiating the events mentioned above. It is interesting
to note that the malarial parasite requires two hosts – human and
mosquitoes – to complete its life cycle (Figure 8.1); the female Anopheles
mosquito is the vector (transmitting agent) too.

Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite in the large intestine of
human which causes amoebiasis (amoebic dysentery). Symptoms of
this disease include constipation, abdominal pain and cramps, stools
with excess mucous and blood clots. Houseflies act as mechanical carriers
and serve to transmit the parasite from faeces of infected person to foodHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
and food products, thereby contaminating them.
Drinking water and food contaminated by the faecal
matter are the main source of infection.
Ascaris, the common round worm and Wuchereria,
the filarial worm, are some of the helminths which are
known to be pathogenic to man. Ascaris, an intestinal
parasite causes ascariasis. Symptoms of these disease
include internal bleeding, muscular pain, fever, anemia
and blockage of the intestinal passage. The eggs of the
parasite are excreted along with the faeces of infected
persons which contaminate soil, water, plants, etc. A
healthy person acquires this infection through
contaminated water, vegetables, fruits, etc.
Wuchereria (W. bancrofti and W. malayi), the filarial
worms cause a slowly developing chronic inflammation
of the organs in which they live for many years, usually
the lymphatic vessels of the lower limbs and the disease
is called elephantiasis or filariasis (Figure 8.2). The
genital organs are also often affected, resulting in gross
deformities. The pathogens are transmitted to a healthy

Appearance of dry, scaly lesions on various
parts of the body such as skin, nails and
scalp (Figure 8.3) are the main symptoms of
the disease. These lesions are accompanied
by intense itching. Heat and moisture help
these fungi to grow, which makes them thrive
in skin folds such as those in the groin or
between the toes. Ringworms are generally

or even the comb of infected individuals.
Maintenance of personal and public hygiene is very important for
prevention and control of many infectious diseases. Measures for personal
hygiene include keeping the body clean; consumption of clean drinking
water, food, vegetables, fruits, etc. Public hygiene includes proper disposal
149
of waste and excreta; periodic cleaning and disinfection of water reservoirs,
pools, cesspools and tanks and observing standard practices of hygiene
in public catering. These measures are particularly essential where the
infectious agents are transmitted through food and water such as typhoid,
amoebiasis and ascariasis. In cases of air-borne diseases such as
pneumonia and common cold, in addition to the above measures, closeBIOLOGY
contact with the infected persons or their belongings should be avoided.
For diseases such as malaria and filariasis that are transmitted through
insect vectors, the most important measure is to control or eliminate the
vectors and their breeding places. This can be achieved by avoiding
stagnation of water in and around residential areas, regular cleaning of
household coolers, use of mosquito nets, introducing fishes like Gambusia
in ponds that feed on mosquito larvae, spraying of insecticides in ditches,
drainage areas and swamps, etc. In addition, doors and windows should
be provided with wire mesh to prevent the entry of mosquitoes. Such
precautions have become all the more important especially in the light of
recent widespread incidences of the vector-borne (Aedes mosquitoes)
diseases like dengue and chikungunya in many parts of India.
The advancements made in biological science have armed us to
effectively deal with many infectious diseases. The use of vaccines and
immunisation programmes have enabled us to completely eradicate a
deadly disease like smallpox. A large number of other infectious diseases
like polio, diphtheria, pneumonia and tetanus have been controlled to a
large extent by the use of vaccines. Biotechnology (about which you will
read more in Chapter 12) is at the verge of making available newer and
safer vaccines. Discovery of antibiotics and various other drugs has also
enabled us to effectively treat infectious diseases.
8.2 I MMUNITY
Everyday we are exposed to large number of infectious agents. However,
only a few of these exposures result in disease. Why? This is due to the
fact that the body is able to defend itself from most of these foreign agents.
This overall ability of the host to fight the disease-causing organisms,
conferred by the immune system is called immunity.
Immunity is of two types: (i) Innate immunity and (ii) Acquired
immunity.
8.2.1 Innate Immunity
150
Innate immunity is non-specific type of defence, that is present at the
time of birth. This is accomplished by providing different types of barriers
to the entry of the foreign agents into our body. Innate immunity consist
of four types of barriers. These are —
(i) Physical barriers : Skin on our body is the main barrier which
prevents entry of the micro-organisms. Mucus coating of the
epithelium lining the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital
tracts also help in trapping microbes entering our body.
(ii) Physiological barriers : Acid in the stomach, saliva in the mouth,
tears from eyes–all prevent microbial growth.
(iii) Cellular barriers : Certain types of leukocytes (WBC) of our body
like polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes (PMNL-neutrophils) andHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
monocytes and natural killer (type of lymphocytes) in the blood as
well as macrophages in tissues can phagocytose and destroy
microbes.
(iv) Cytokine barriers : Virus-infected cells secrete proteins called
interferons which protect non-infected cells from further viral infection.
8.2.2 Acquired Immunity
Acquired immunity, on the other hand, is pathogen specific. It is
characterised by memory. This means that our body when it encounters
a pathogen for the first time produces a response called primary response
which is of low intensity. Subsequent encounter with the same pathogen
elicits a highly intensified secondary or anamnestic response. This
is ascribed to the fact that our body appears to have memory of the
first encounter.
The primary and secondary
immune responses are carried
out with the help of two
special types of lymphocytes
present in our blood,
i.e., B-lymphocytes and T-
lymphocytes.The B-lymphocytes
produce an army of proteins in
response to pathogens into our
blood to fight with them. These
proteins are called antibodies.
The T-cells themselves do not
secrete antibodies but help B
cells produce them. Each
antibody molecule has four
peptide chains, two small called
light chains and two longer
called heavy chains. Hence, an
antibody is represented as H 2 L 2 .
Figure 8.4 Structure of an antibody molecule
Different types of antibodies are
produced in our body. IgA, IgM, IgE, IgG are some of them. A cartoon of
an antibody is given in Figure 8.4. Because these antibodies are found in
the blood, the response is also called as humoral immune response.
This is one of the two types of our acquired immune response – antibody
mediated. The second type is called cell-mediated immune response or
cell-mediated immunity (CMI). The T-lymphocytes mediate CMI. Very
often, when some human organs like heart, eye, liver, kidney fail to function
satisfactorily, transplantation is the only remedy to enable the patient to
live a normal life. Then a search begins – to find a suitable donor. Why is
it that the organs cannot be taken from just anybody? What is it that
151BIOLOGY
the doctors check? Grafts from just any source – an animal, another
primate, or any human beings cannot be made since the grafts would be
rejected sooner or later. Tissue matching, blood group matching are
essential before undertaking any graft/transplant and even after this the
patient has to take immuno–suppresants all his/her life. The body is able
to differentiate ‘self ’ and ‘nonself’ and the cell-mediated immune response
is responsible for the graft rejection.
8.2.3 Active and Passive Immunity
When a host is exposed to antigens, which may be in the form of living
or dead microbes or other proteins, antibodies are produced in the host
body. This type of immunity is called active immunity. Active immunity
is slow and takes time to give its full effective response. Injecting the
microbes deliberately during immunisation or infectious organisms
gaining access into body during natural infection induce active
immunity. When ready-made antibodies are directly given to protect
the body against foreign agents, it is called passive immunity. Do you
know why mother’s milk is considered very essential for the new-
born infant? The yellowish fluid colostrum secreted by mother during
the initial days of lactation has abundant antibodies (IgA) to protect the
infant. The foetus also receives some antibodies from their mother,
through the placenta during pregnancy. These are some examples of
passive immunity.
8.2.4 Vaccination and Immunisation
152
The principle of immunisation or vaccination is based on the property of
‘memory’ of the immune system. In vaccination, a preparation of antigenic
proteins of pathogen or inactivated/weakened pathogen (vaccine) are
introduced into the body. The antibodies produced in the body against
these antigens would neutralise the pathogenic agents during actual
infection. The vaccines also generate memory – B and T-cells that recognise
the pathogen quickly on subsequent exposure and overwhelm the
invaders with a massive production of antibodies. If a person is infected
with some deadly microbes to which quick immune response is required
as in tetanus, we need to directly inject the preformed antibodies, or
antitoxin (a preparation containing antibodies to the toxin). Even in cases
of snakebites, the injection which is given to the patients, contain preformed
antibodies against the snake venom. This type of immunisation is called
passive immunisation.
Recombinant DNA technology has allowed the production of antigenic
polypeptides of pathogen in bacteria or yeast. Vaccines produced using
this approach allow large scale production and hence greater availability
for immunisation, e.g., hepatitis B vaccine produced from yeast.HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
8.2.5 Allergies
When you have gone to a new place and suddenly you started sneezing,
wheezing for no explained reason, and when you went away, your
symptoms dissappeared. Did this happen to you? Some of us are sensitive
to some particles in the environment. The above-mentioned reaction could
be because of allergy to pollen, mites, etc., which are different in different
places.
The exaggerated response of the immune system to certain antigens
present in the environment is called allergy. The substances to which
such an immune response is produced are called allergens. The antibodies
produced to these are of IgE type. Common examples of allergens are
mites in dust, pollens, animal dander, etc. Symptoms of allergic reactions
include sneezing, watery eyes, running nose and difficulty in breathing.
Allergy is due to the release of chemicals like histamine and serotonin
from the mast cells. For determining the cause of allergy, the patient is
exposed to or injected with very small doses of possible allergens, and the
reactions studied. The use of drugs like anti-histamine, adrenalin and
steroids quickly reduce the symptoms of allergy. Somehow, modern-day
life style has resulted in lowering of immunity and more sensitivity to
allergens – more and more children in metro cities of India suffer from
allergies and asthma due to sensitivity to the environment. This could be
because of the protected environment provided early in life.
8.2.6 Auto Immunity
Memory-based acquired immunity evolved in higher vertebrates based
on the ability to differentiate foreign organisms (e.g., pathogens) from self-
cells. While we still do not understand the basis of this, two corollaries of
this ability have to be understood. One, higher vertebrates can distinguish
foreign molecules as well as foreign organisms. Most of the experimental
immunology deals with this aspect. Two, sometimes, due to genetic and
other unknown reasons, the body attacks self-cells. This results in damage
to the body and is called auto-immune disease. Rheumatoid arthritis
which affects many people in our society is an auto-immune disease.
8.2.7 Immune System in the Body
The human immune system consists of lymphoid organs, tissues, cells
and soluble molecules like antibodies. As you have read, immune system
is unique in the sense that it recognises foreign antigens, responds to
these and remembers them. The immune system also plays an important
role in allergic reactions, auto-immune diseases and organ
transplantation.

and proliferation of lymphocytes occur. The primary lymphoid organs
are bone marrow and thymus where immature lymphocytes differentiate
153BIOLOGY

into antigen-sensitive lymphocytes. After maturation the
lymphocytes migrate to secondary lymphoid organs like spleen,
lymph nodes, tonsils, Peyer’s patches of small intestine and
appendix. The secondary lymphoid organs provide the sites for
interaction of lymphocytes with the antigen, which then proliferate
to become effector cells. The location of various lymphoid organs
in the human body is shown in Figure 8.5.
The bone marrow is the main lymphoid organ where all
blood cells including lymphocytes are produced. The thymus
is a lobed organ located near the heart and beneath the
breastbone. The thymus is quite large at the time of birth but
keeps reducing in size with age and by the time puberty is
attained it reduces to a very small size. Both bone-marrow
and thymus provide micro-environments for the development
and maturation of T-lymphocytes. The spleen is a large bean-
shaped organ. It mainly contains lymphocytes and phagocytes.

organisms. Spleen also has a large reservoir of erythrocytes.
of L ymph nodes
The lymph nodes are small solid structures located at different
points along the lymphatic system. Lymph nodes serve to trap the
micro-organisms or other antigens, which happen to get into the lymph
and tissue fluid. Antigens trapped in the lymph nodes are responsible for
the activation of lymphocytes present there and cause the immune
response.
There is lymphoid tissue also located within the lining of the major
tracts (respiratory, digestive and urogenital tracts) called mucosa-
associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). It constitutes about 50 per cent of
the lymphoid tissue in human body.
8.3 AIDS
154
The word AIDS stands for Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome.
This means deficiency of immune system, acquired during the lifetime of
an individual indicating that it is not a congenital disease. ‘Syndrome’
means a group of symptoms. AIDS was first reported in 1981 and in the
last twenty-five years or so, it has spread all over the world killing more
than 25 million persons.
AIDS is caused by the Human Immuno deficiency Virus (HIV), a
member of a group of viruses called retrovirus, which have an envelope
enclosing the RNA genome (Figure 8.6). Transmission of HIV-infection
generally occurs by (a) sexual contact with infected person, (b) by
transfusion of contaminated blood and blood products, (c) by sharing
infected needles as in the case of intravenous drug abusers and (d) from
infected mother to her child through placenta. So, people who are at high
risk of getting this infection includes - individuals who have multipleHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
Figure 8.6 Replication of retrovirus
sexual partners, drug addicts who take drugs intravenously, individuals
who require repeated blood transfusions and children born to an HIV
infected mother. Do you know –when do people need repeated blood
transfusion? Find out and make a list of such conditions. It is important
to note that HIV/AIDS is not spread by mere touch or physical contact; it
spreads only through body fluids. It is, hence, imperative, for the physical
and psychological well-being, that the HIV/AIDS infected persons are
not isolated from family and society. There is always a time-lag between
the infection and appearance of AIDS symptoms. This period may vary
from a few months to many years (usually 5-10 years).
155BIOLOGY
After getting into the body of the person, the virus enters into macrophages
where RNA genome of the virus replicates to form viral DNA with the help of
the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This viral DNA gets incorporated into host
cell’s DNA and directs the infected cells to produce virus particles (Figure 8.6).
The macrophages continue to produce virus and in this way acts like a HIV
factory.
Simultaneously,
HIV
enters
into
helper
T-lymphocytes (T H ), replicates and produce progeny viruses. The progeny
viruses released in the blood attack other helper T-lymphocytes. This is
repeated leading to a progressive decrease in the number of helper T-
lymphocytes in the body of the infected person. During this period, the person
suffers from bouts of fever, diarrhoea and weight loss. Due to decrease in
the number of helper T lymphocytes, the person starts suffering from infections
that could have been otherwise overcome such as those due to bacteria
especially Mycobacterium, viruses, fungi and even parasites like Toxoplasma.
The patient becomes so immuno-deficient that he/she is unable to protect
himself/herself against these infections. A widely used diagnostic test for
AIDS is enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). Treatment of AIDS
with anti-retroviral drugs is only partially effective. They can only prolong
the life of the patient but cannot prevent death, which is inevitable.
156
Prevention of AIDS : As AIDS has no cure, prevention is the best option.
Moreover, HIV infection, more often, spreads due to conscious behaviour
patterns and is not something that happens inadvertently, like pneumonia
or typhoid. Of course, infection in blood transfusion patients, new-borns
(from mother) etc., may take place due to poor monitoring. The only excuse
may be ignorance and it has been rightly said – “don’t die of ignorance”.
In our country the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and other
non-governmental organisation (NGOs) are doing a lot to educate people
about AIDS. WHO has started a number of programmes to prevent the
spreading of HIV infection. Making blood (from blood banks) safe from
HIV, ensuring the use of only disposable needles and syringes in public
and private hospitals and clinics, free distribution of condoms, controlling
drug abuse, advocating safe sex and promoting regular check-ups for
HIV in susceptible populations, are some such steps taken up.
Infection with HIV or having AIDS is something that should not be
hidden – since then, the infection may spread to many more people.
HIV/AIDS-infected people need help and sympathy instead of being
shunned by society. Unless society recognises it as a problem to be dealt
with in a collective manner – the chances of wider spread of the disease
increase manifold. It is a malady that can only be tackled, by the society
and medical fraternity acting together, to prevent the spread of the disease.
8.4 C ANCER
Cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases of human beings and is a major
cause of death all over the globe. More than a million Indians suffer fromHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
cancer and a large number of them die from it annually. The mechanisms
that underlie development of cancer or oncogenic transformation of cells,
its treatment and control have been some of the most intense areas of
research in biology and medicine.
In our body, cell growth and differentiation is highly controlled and
regulated. In cancer cells, there is breakdown of these regulatory
mechanisms. Normal cells show a property called contact inhibition by
virtue of which contact with other cells inhibits their uncontrolled growth.
Cancer cells appears to have lost this property. As a result of this, cancerous
cells just continue to divide giving rise to masses of cells called tumors.
Tumors are of two types: benign and malignant. Benign tumors normally
remain confined to their original location and do not spread to other parts
of the body and cause little damage. The malignant tumors, on the
other hand are a mass of proliferating cells called neoplastic or tumor
cells. These cells grow very rapidly, invading and damaging the
surrounding normal tissues. As these cells actively divide and grow they
also starve the normal cells by competing for vital nutrients. Cells sloughed
from such tumors reach distant sites through blood, and wherever they
get lodged in the body, they start a new tumor there. This property called
metastasis is the most feared property of malignant tumors.
Causes of cancer : Transformation of normal cells into cancerous
neoplastic cells may be induced by physical, chemical or biological agents.
These agents are called carcinogens. Ionising radiations like X-rays and
gamma rays and non-ionizing radiations like UV cause DNA damage
leading to neoplastic transformation. The chemical carcinogens present
in tobacco smoke have been identified as a major cause of lung cancer.
Cancer causing viruses called oncogenic viruses have genes called viral
oncogenes. Furthermore, several genes called cellular oncogenes
(c-onc) or proto oncogenes have been identified in normal cells which,
when activated under certain conditions, could lead to oncogenic
transformation of the cells.
Cancer detection and diagnosis : Early detection of cancers is essential
as it allows the disease to be treated successfully in many cases. Cancer
detection is based on biopsy and histopathological studies of the tissue
and blood and bone marrow tests for increased cell counts in the case of
leukemias. In biopsy, a piece of the suspected tissue cut into thin sections
is stained and examined under microscope (histopathological studies) by
a pathologist. Techniques like radiography (use of X-rays), CT (computed
tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) are very useful to
detect cancers of the internal organs. Computed tomography uses X-rays
to generate a three-dimensional image of the internals of an object. MRI
uses strong magnetic fields and non-ionising radiations to accurately detect
pathological and physiological changes in the living tissue.
Antibodies against cancer -specific antigens are also used for
detection of certain cancers. Techniques of molecular biology can be
157BIOLOGY
applied to detect genes in individuals with inherited susceptibility to
certain cancers. Identification of such genes, which predispose an
individual to certain cancers, may be very helpful in prevention of
cancers. Such individuals may be advised to avoid exposure to
particular carcinogens to which they are susceptible (e.g., tobacco
smoke in case of lung cancer).
Treatment of cancer : The common approaches for treatment of cancer
are surgery, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. In radiotherapy,
tumor cells are irradiated lethally, taking proper care of the normal tissues
surrounding the tumor mass. Several chemotherapeutic drugs are used
to kill cancerous cells. Some of these are specific for particular tumors.
Majority of drugs have side effects like hair loss, anemia, etc. Most cancers
are treated by combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
Tumor cells have been shown to avoid detection and destruction by
immune system. Therefore, the patients are given substances called
biological response modifiers such as α -interferon which activates their
immune system and helps in destroying the tumor.
8.5 D RUGS
AND
A LCOHOL A BUSE
Surveys and statistics show that use of drugs and alcohol has been on
the rise especially among the youth. This is really a cause of concern as it
could result in many harmful effects. Proper education and guidance
would enable youth to safeguard themselves against these dangerous
behaviour patterns and follow healthy lifestyles.
The drugs, which are commonly abused are opioids, cannabinoids
and coca alkaloids. Majority of these are obtained from flowering plants.
Some are obtained from fungi.
Opioids are the drugs, which bind to specific opioid receptors present
in our central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Heroin
(Figure 8.7), commonly called smack is chemically diacetylmorphine which
is a white, odourless, bitter crystalline compound. This is obtained by
acetylation of morphine (Figure 8.7), which is extracted from the latex of
158
Figure 8.7 Chemical structure of Morphine
Figure 8.8 Opium poppyHUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
poppy plant Papaver somniferum (Figure 8.8). Generally taken by snorting
and injection, heroin is a depressant and slows down body functions.
Cannabinoids are a group of chemicals (Figure 8.9), which interact
with cannabinoid receptors present principally in the brain. Natural
cannabinoids are obtained from the inflorescences of the plant Cannabis
sativa (Figure 8.10). The flower tops, leaves and the resin of cannabis
plant are used in various combinations to produce marijuana, hashish,
charas and ganja. Generally taken by inhalation and oral ingestion, these
are known for their effects on cardiovascular system of the body.
Figure 8.9 Skeletal structure of
cannabinoid molecule
Figure 8.10 Leaves of Cannabis sativa
Coca alkaloid or cocaine is obtained from coca
plant Erythroxylum coca, native to South America. It
interferes with the transport of the neuro-transmitter
dopamine. Cocaine, commonly called coke or crack is
usually snorted. It has a potent stimulating action on
central nervous system, producing a sense of euphoria
and increased energy. Excessive dosage of cocaine
causes hallucinations. Other well-known plants with
hallucinogenic properties are Atropa belladona and
Datura (Figure 8.11). These days cannabinoids are also
being abused by some sportspersons.
Drugs like barbiturates, amphetamines,
benzodiazepines, and other similar drugs, that are
normally used as medicines to help patients cope with
Figure 8.11 Flowering branch of Datura
mental illnesses like depression and insomnia, are often
abused. Morphine is a very effective sedative and painkiller, and is very useful
159
in patients who have undergone surgery. Several plants, fruits and seeds
having hallucinogenic properties have been used for hundreds of years in
folk-medicine, religious ceremonies and rituals all over the globe. When these
are taken for a purpose other than medicinal use or in amounts/frequency
that impairs one’s physical, physiological or psychological functions, it
constitutes drug abuse.BIOLOGY
Smoking also paves the way to hard drugs. Tobacco has been used
by human beings for more than 400 years. It is smoked, chewed or used
as a snuff. Tobacco contains a large number of chemical substances
including nicotine, an alkaloid. Nicotine stimulates adrenal gland to
release adrenaline and nor-adrenaline into blood circulation, both of
which raise blood pressure and increase heart rate. Smoking is associated
with increased incidence of cancers of lung, urinary bladder and throat,
bronchitis, emphysema, coronary heart disease, gastric ulcer, etc. Tobacco
chewing is associated with increased risk of cancer of the oral cavity.
Smoking increases carbon monoxide (CO) content in blood and reduces
the concentration of haembound oxygen. This causes oxygen deficiency
in the body.
When one buys packets of cigarettes one cannot miss the statutory
warning that is present on the packing which warns against smoking
and says how it is injurious to health. Yet, smoking is very prevalent in
society, both among young and old. Knowing the dangers of smoking
and chewing tobacco, and its addictive nature, the youth and old need to
avoid these habits. Any addict requires counselling and medical help to
get rid of the habit.
8.5.1 Adolescence and Drug/Alcohol Abuse
160
Adolescence means both ‘a period’ and ‘a process’ during which a child
becomes mature in terms of his/her attitudes and beliefs for effective
participation in society. The period between 12-18 years of age may
be thought of as adolescence period. In other words, adolescence is a
bridge linking childhood and adulthood. Adolescence is accompanied
by several biological and behavioural changes. Adolescence, thus is a
very vulnerable phase of mental and psychological development of an
individual.
Curiosity, need for adventure and excitement, and experimentation,
constitute common causes, which motivate youngsters towards drug
and alcohol use. A child’s natural curiosity motivates him/her to
experiment. This is complicated further by effects that might be perceived
as benefits, of alcohol or drug use. Thus, the first use of drugs or alcohol
may be out of curiosity or experimentation, but later the child starts
using these to escape facing problems. Of late, stress, from pressures to
excel in academics or examinations, has played a significant role in
persuading the youngsters to try alcohol and drugs. The perception
among youth that it is ‘cool’ or progressive to smoke, use drugs or
alcohol, is also in a way a major cause for youth to start these habits.
Television, movies, newspapers, internet also help to promote this
perception. Other factors that have been seen to be associated with drug
and alcohol abuse among adolescents are unstable or unsupportive
family structures and peer pressure.HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
8.5.2 Addiction and Dependence
Because of the perceived benefits, drugs are frequently used repeatedly.
The most important thing, which one fails to realise, is the inherent
addictive nature of alcohol and drugs. Addiction is a psychological
attachment to certain effects – such as euphoria and a temporary feeling
of well-being – associated with drugs and alcohol. These drive people to
take them even when these are not needed, or even when their use becomes
self-destructive. With repeated use of drugs, the tolerance level of the
receptors present in our body increases. Consequently the receptors
respond only to higher doses of drugs or alcohol leading to greater intake
and addiction. However, it should be clearly borne in mind that use of
these drugs even once, can be a fore-runner to addiction. Thus, the
addictive potential of drugs and alcohol, pull the user into a vicious circle
leading to their regular use (abuse) from which he/she may not be able
to get out. In the absence of any guidance or counselling, the person gets
addicted and becomes dependent on their use.
Dependence is the tendency of the body to manifest a characteristic
and unpleasant withdrawal syndrome if regular dose of drugs/alcohol
is abruptly discontinued. This is characterised by anxiety, shakiness,
nausea and sweating, which may be relieved when use is resumed again.
In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be severe and even life
threatening and the person may need medical supervision.
Dependence leads the patient to ignore all social norms in order to
get sufficient funds to satiate his/her needs. These result in many social
adjustment problems.
8.5.3 Effects of Drug/Alcohol Abuse
The immediate adverse effects of drugs and alcohol abuse are manifested
in the form of reckless behaviour, vandalism and violence. Excessive
doses of drugs may lead to coma and death due to respiratory failure,
heart failure or cerebral hemorrhage. A combination of drugs or their
intake along with alcohol generally results in overdosing and even
deaths. The most common warning signs of drug and alcohol abuse
among youth include drop in academic performance, unexplained
absence from school/college, lack of interest in personal hygiene,
withdrawal, isolation, depression, fatigue, aggressive and rebellious
behaviour, deteriorating relationships with family and friends, loss of
interest in hobbies, change in sleeping and eating habits, fluctuations
in weight, appetite, etc.
There may even be some far-reaching implications of drug/alcohol
abuse. If an abuser is unable to get money to buy drugs/alcohol he/she
may turn to stealing. The adverse effects are just not restricted to the
person who is using drugs or alcohol. At times, a drug/alcohol addict
becomes the cause of mental and financial distress to his/her entire family
and friends.
161BIOLOGY
Those who take drugs intravenously (direct injection into the vein
using a needle and syringe), are much more likely to acquire serious
infections like AIDS and Hepatitis B. The viruses, which are responsible
for these diseases, are transferred from one person to another by sharing
of infected needles and syringes. Both AIDS and Hepatitis B infections
are chronic infections and ultimately fatal. Both can be transmitted
through sexual contact or infected blood.
The use of alcohol during adolescence may also have long-term effects.
It could lead to heavy drinking in adulthood. The chronic use of drugs and
alcohol damages nervous system and liver (cirrhosis). The use of drugs
and alcohol during pregnancy is also known to adversely affect the foetus.
Another misuse of drugs is what certain sportspersons do to enhance
their performance. They (mis)use narcotic analgesics, anabolic steroids,
diuretics and certain hormones in sports to increase muscle strength and
bulk and to promote aggressiveness and as a result increase athletic
performance. The side-effects of the use of anabolic steroids in females
include masculinisation (features like males), increased aggressiveness,
mood swings, depression, abnormal menstrual cycles, excessive hair
growth on the face and body, enlargement of clitoris, deepening of voice.
In males it includes acne, increased aggressiveness, mood swings,
depression, reduction of size of the testicles, decreased sperm production,
potential for kidney and liver dysfunction, breast enlargement, premature
baldness, enlargement of the prostate gland. These effects may be
permanent with prolonged use. In the adolescent male or female, severe
facial and body acne, and premature closure of the growth centres of the
long bones may result in stunted growth.
8.5.4 Prevention and Control
162
The age-old adage of ‘prevention is better than cure’ holds true here also.
It is also true that habits such as smoking, taking drug or alcohol are
more likely to be taken up at a young age, more during adolescence.
Hence, it is best to identify the situations that may push an adolescent
towards use of drugs or alcohol, and to take remedial measures well in
time. In this regard, the parents and the teachers have a special
responsibility. Parenting that combines with high levels of nurturance
and consistent discipline, has been associated with lowered risk of
substance (alcohol/drugs/tobacco) abuse. Some of the measures
mentioned here would be particularly useful for prevention and control
of alcohol and drugs abuse among adolescents
(i) Avoid undue peer pressure - Every child has his/her own choice
and personality, which should be respected and nurtured. A child
should not be pushed unduly to perform beyond his/her threshold
limits; be it studies, sports or other activities.HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
(ii) Education and counselling - Educating and counselling him/
her to face problems and stresses, and to accept disappointments
and failures as a part of life. It would also be worthwhile to channelise
the child’s energy into healthy pursuits like sports, reading, music,
yoga and other extracurricular activities.
(iii) Seeking help from parents and peers - Help from parents and
peers should be sought immediately so that they can guide
appropriately. Help may even be sought from close and trusted
friends. Besides getting proper advise to sort out their problems,
this would help young to vent their feelings of anxiety and guilt.
(iv) Looking for danger signs - Alert parents and teachers need to
look for and identify the danger signs discussed above. Even friends,
if they find someone using drugs or alcohol, should not hesitate to
bring this to the notice of parents or teacher in the best interests of
the person concerned. Appropriate measures would then be required
to diagnose the malady and the underlying causes. This would help
in initiating proper remedial steps or treatment.
(v) Seeking professional and medical help - A lot of help is available
in the form of highly qualified psychologists, psychiatrists, and de-
addiction and rehabilitation programmes to help individuals who
have unfortunately got in the quagmire of drug/alcohol abuse. With
such help, the affected individual with sufficient efforts and will power,
can get rid of the problem completely and lead a perfectly normal
and healthy life.
SUMMARY
Health is not just the absence of disease. It is a state of complete physical,
mental, social and psychological well-being. Diseases like typhoid,
cholera, pneumonia, fungal infections of skin, malaria and many others
are a major cause of distress to human beings. Vector-borne diseases
like malaria especially one caused by Plasmodium falciparum, if not
treated, may prove fatal. Besides personal cleanliness and hygiene,
public health measures like proper disposal of waste, decontamination
of drinking water, control of vectors like mosquitoes and immunisation
are very helpful in preventing these diseases. Our immune system plays
the major role in preventing these diseases when we are exposed to
disease-causing agents. The innate defences of our body like skin,
mucous membranes, antimicrobial substances present in our tears,
saliva and the phagocytic cells help to block the entry of pathogens
into our body. If the pathogens succeed in gaining entry to our body,
specific antibodies (humoral immune response) and cells (cell mediated
immune response) serve to kill these pathogens. Immune system has
memory. On subsequent exposure to same pathogen, the immune
response is rapid and more intense. This forms the basis of protection
163BIOLOGY
afforded by vaccination and immunisation. Among other diseases, AIDS
and cancer kill a large number of individuals worldwide. AIDS caused
by the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) is fatal but can be
prevented if certain precautions are taken. Many cancers are curable if
detected early and appropriate therapeutic measures are taken. Of late,
drug and alcohol abuse among youth and adolescents is becoming
another cause of concern. Because of the addictive nature of alcohol
and drugs, and their perceived benefits like relief from stress, a person
may try taking these in the face of peer pressure, examinations-related
and competition-related stresses. In doing so, he/she may get addicted
to them. Education about their harmful effects, counselling and seeking
immediate professional and medical help would totally relieve the
individual from these evils.
